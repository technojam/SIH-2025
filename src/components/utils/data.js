          "1579 Developing writing pen and writing pad for children with Specific learning disability. Background: Children with Specific Learning Disability (SLD)who faces challenge of writing during their academic life especially during examinations where they need the provisions of a scribe. The purp ose of rehabilitating people with disabilities is to reduce the dependence on other people. In order to achieve this fundamental right to be independent, it is important to develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing penand writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this.\nDetailed Description: In India, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other educational boards provide several relaxations for students with learning disabilities (SLD) during examinations such as having a scribe during exams. A scribe writes answers as dictated by the child. The scribe must be from a lower grade than the child appearing for the exam. CBSE provides remuneration for the scribe, and you can also apply for your own scribe if needed. If a child has difficulty reading, they are entitled to a reader who reads (not explains) the questions to the child. However, a child can have either a reader or a scribe, not both. CBSE grants additional time to students with disabilities. For example:\n60 extra minutes for a three-hour exam\n40 extra minutes for a two-hour exam\n30 extra minutes for a one-and-a-half-hour exam.\nSince January 2020, CBSE allows the use of calculators for children with dyscalculia. The board provides these calculators.Theseaccommodations aim to create a level playing field for students with learning disabilities, ensuring they can demonstrate their knowledge effectively during exams. However it has some disadvantages as well like some students may become overly reliant on scribes, affecting their independent writing skills.Students may feel uncomfortable dictating their answers to someone else. Availability of trained scribes can be a challenge, especially during exams. The quality of scribing may vary, impacting the accuracy of the student’s responses. Also some of the people are misusing the benefits by training or teaching the scribe rather than the child with SLD to write the exam and score good marks.\nExpected Solutions: To develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing pen and writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this.",

However, due to lack of communication or visibility, these users may unknowingly download duplicate copies of the same data. This leads to unnecessary consumption of resources, including bandwidth and storage, and complicates data management. The DDAS (Data download Duplication Alert System) addresses this issue by notifying users with an alert if a potential duplicate download is identified. This system helps optimize resource usage, save time, and streamline data management processes.\nDescription: Managing data downloads efficiently is crucial for optimizing resources and maintaining order in any organization. A DDAS addresses the issue of multiple users inadvertently downloading duplicate copies of the same datasets across various fields.\nThe DDAS operates by maintaining a repository or database that records metadata of all downloaded datasets. This metadata includes details such as file names, sizes, timestamps, and download locations. When a user initiates a download request, the system checks the database to determine if the dataset has already been downloaded by any user. To identify duplicates accurately, the system uses file history or unique identifiers, ensuring duplicates are detected even if file names differ.\nIf a potential duplicate is detected, the system prompts the user with an alert. This alert provides comprehensive information about the existing dataset, including its location and the timestamp of the original download. By doing so, the DDAS helps users avoid unnecessary downloads, thereby optimizing resource usage, saving time, and streamlining data management processes.\nThis system is designed to be flexible and applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, and any other domain where efficient data management is critical. By preventing duplicate downloads, the DDAS ensures that resources are used effectively, contributing to overall organizational efficiency.\nExpected Solution: To mitigate this issue, a robust solution is needed to design and develop a system that generates alerts when users attempt to download data already available within the institute's repository or any of the user accounts. The alert system should promptly notify users about the existence, properties (such as the period, spatial domain, and other relevant data attributes), and location of the required data, thereby preventing unnecessary duplication and promoting efficient resource utilization. Implementing this solution allows organizations to streamline data access processes and reduce redundancy. This system has to be applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, government agencies, and more.",

          "1683 Development of AI/ML based solution for detection of face-swap based deep fake videos Background: Synthetically-generated audios and videos i.e. deep fakes are in trends nowadays. Although these have caught imagination of computer and tech savvy generation, at the same time, these have created concerns because of their ability to disrupt nation’s politics, committing frauds, create dis-information and creating non-consensual contents. Use of Deep fake has also been seen recently to purposefully defame the character of a person in specific. Due to enhancements in AI/ML and Large Language Models for Generative AI, identification and detection of deep fakes have created a huge challenge for Security Agencies. Research on multiple aspects of deep fake identification has been started. As a use case for the problem statement, a forensic technique to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's may be developed.\nDetailed description: Addressing the deep fake problem requires a multi-pronged approach, combining technology, regulation, education, and collaboration to mitigate the risks and protect individuals and society. However, on the technological front Detecting deep fakes involves development and testing with numerous advanced algorithms and tools. Here are some of the prominent approaches and technologies that can be used in deep fake detection: \ni.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs can be trained to detect inconsistencies in facial features, expressions, and movements. CNNs can also analyse video frames over time to identify unnatural transitions and discrepancies. \nii.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: RNNs and LSTMs can be used to analyse the sequence of frames in a video to detect temporal anomalies and inconsistencies indicative of deep fakes. \niii.Capsule Networks: Capsule networks can identify discrepancies in facial pose and texture. \niv.Adversarial Training: Adversarial training involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate deep fakes and simultaneously training another model to detect them improving the robustness of detection algorithms. \nv.Audio-Visual Inconsistencies: Combining audio and visual analysis can also help detect deep fakes by identifying mismatches between lip movements and speech, or inconsistencies in ambient sounds. \nvi.Blockchain Technology: Using blockchain to create immutable records of media, providing a verifiable chain of custody for digital content to ensure its authenticity. \nvii.Frequency Analysis: Analysing the frequency domain of images and videos to detect anomalies and artefacts introduced during the deep fake creation process. \nviii.Biometric Verification: Analysing subtle behavioural traits such as micro-expressions, eye and head movement to detect anomalies. \nix.Hybrid Models: Using a combination of spatial, temporal, audio and frequency analysis to improve the robustness and accuracy of deep fake detection. \nExpected solution: A solution based on AI/ML technology may be developed to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's. This technique may be based on any of the above-mentioned methods or it may combine multiple methods and demonstrate the final deliverable of detection of deep fakes with accuracy. The input of the system will be a video which is suspected of deep fake and the output should contain detailed report w.r.t various characteristics of deep fake e.g. whether confirmed fake (details of abnormalities observed), mathematical underlying techniques of its creation.",

        Description:
          "1708 Tool for secure automatic network topology \ncreation.\n BACKGROUND: \nIn a SCADA system, for a pipeline network spanning thousands of kilometres, the network devices (both layer 2 and layer 3) are spread all along the geographical area. With such a large network, it becomes crucial, from both the maintenance and security point of view, to continuously monitor the complete network topology. Automatic topology discovery provides a complete and up-to-date map of all devices, connections, and pathways within the SCADA network. This comprehensive overview is essential for network administrators to understand the network's structure and dynamics. It ensures that any changes in the network, such as new devices being added or existing ones being removed, are automatically detected and documented in real time. When issues arise, knowing the exact layout and connections within the network helps in pinpointing problems more quickly, reducing downtime and improving response times. More significantly, automatic topology discovery helps in identifying unauthorized devices or unexpected changes in the network, which could indicate security breaches or cyber-attacks and allows for better network segmentation and implementation of access controls, limiting the spread of potential threats and protecting critical assets. Conventionally, automatic topology discovery tools utilize Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). However, these protocols are vulnerable due to lack of authentication, broadcast of sensitive information, etc. and hence are not suitable for use in a critical pipeline SCADA network.\nProblem Statement Details:\n“Develop a tool for automatic network topology discovery, for a network using EIGRP routing protocol, that does not rely on CDP or LLDP protocols. The tool may use secure SNMPv3 polls/traps, ARP/MAC tables, NetFlow, routing protocol or syslog data for creating the automatic network topology. The challenge is accurate device identification without relying on the broadcast capabilities of CDP/LLDP and determining the physical and logical connections between devices. It must have a provision to keep the topology map updated with real-time changes in the network along with scalability to ensure that the solution works efficiently across small to large-scale networks. The most important component is to maintain network security to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage during the discovery process.”\nNOTE : GAIL (INDIA) LTD will not provide any hardware, software, license, data or any other resource to SIH hackathon Teams.

          '1756 Data Insights and Strategic Unit (DISU) at the Divisional Level for DoP\n "The Divisional Office as the nerve centre of administration, governance and control over the widespread national postal network requires a robust monitoring, analytics, visualisation and feedback mechanism to take advantage of digitisation and data driven governance." Background: The Department of Posts (DoP) runs a vast network of over 1.65 lakh post offices to deliver a wide range of services in mail and parcel, payments, financial and banking services and retailing of citizen centric services for ease of access and improving the quality of life around each post office. This vast country wide network is managed through the Divisional Offices which are the fulcrum of all activities in post offices within their jurisdiction. With IT Modernization and digitization of processes across its network, there is a wealth of data to govern the DoP in its current context. However, adequate capacity in this direction at the Divisional level has not been developed and the oversight on the postal units in each division is a combination of inspections, visits and web-based reporting in various priority project areas taken up by the Department during the course of the year (financial inclusion drives, Ghar Ghar Tiranga, Swachhta Abhiyaan etc). As it works towards a mature digital and data driven governance model with the Division as the focal point for continuous oversight over priority parameters of network health and performance, DoP seeks a capable Data Insights and Strategic Unit (DISU) at Divisional and higher levels. This DISU, as recommended by the Government of India for all departments under the Data Governance Quality Index and related initiatives, can leverage data to improve service delivery and achieve strategic goals.\nA well-designed DISU will empower DoP to become a data-driven organization. This will lead to:\n· Improve service delivery: Optimize mail delivery routes, predict potential delays, and proactively address customer concerns.\n· Reduce operational costs: Identify areas for resource optimization and cost reduction through data-driven insights.\n· Enhance strategic decision-making: Gain data-backed insights into customer behavior and market trends to develop targeted strategies.\nBy scaling up the solution developed for one Division, DoP can establish a DISU in each of its Divisions as well as higher formations at the Regional, Circle and Headquarters level. This is a key building block of the new governance model that the DoP seeks to implement alongside its digital modernization over the years, specially in the wake of IT Modernization 2.0 project which is launched for the Branch Post Office network and would be launched in the remaining post offices during 2024-25.\nDescription: The challenge involves  designing a comprehensive hardware and software solution for establishing a scalable, future-proof DISU at the Divisional Office and higher levels. This solution should address three key areas:\n·   Data Acquisition and Integration: Develop a system to seamlessly collect data from existing DoP sources and integrate it with potential new data streams (e.g., IoT sensors, social media sentiment analysis).\n·   Data Processing and Storage: Implement a scalable and secure data processing pipeline to handle the growing volume and variety of data. Explore cloud-based storage solutions for efficient data accessibility and disaster recovery.\n·   Advanced Analytics and Insights: Develop robust analytics capabilities to extract valuable insights from the data. This includes utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for predictive maintenance, route optimization, and customer experience analysis.\n·    Data Visualization and Reporting: Design user-friendly dashboards and reports to translate complex data into actionable insights for informed decision-making at all levels within DoP.\n·  Scalability and Adaptability: The solution should be adaptable to accommodate future growth in data volume and evolving business needs of the DoP.\n·    Security and Compliance: Ensure data privacy and security through robust data governance practices and compliance with relevant regulations.\nExpected Solution: Seeking innovative proposals that leverage a combination of hardware and software solutions to build a state-of-the-art DISU. (Interested knowledge institutions can take the challenge in coordination with the Divisions convenient for each of them.)\nHardware:\nScalable servers: To handle the growing volume and complexity of data.\nSecure network infrastructure: To ensure data integrity and protection.\nSensor integration: Explore the integration of IoT sensors in key mail processing centers to gather real-time data on mail movement.\nSoftware:\nData lake platform: To store and manage diverse data sets in a raw, unprocessed format.\nData integration tools: To seamlessly connect with existing systems and external data sources.\nMachine learning and analytics libraries: For data analysis, model development, and visualization.\nBusiness intelligence (BI) platform: To create interactive dashboards and reports for informed decision-making.\nAdditional Considerations:\nPropose solutions that are cost-effective and can be implemented in a phased manner.\nAddress data security and privacy concerns to ensure the safekeeping of citizen information.\nDesign the solution for ease of use by DoP personnel with varying technical skillsets.\nThis challenge provides a unique opportunity to create a future-proof DISU that will empower DoP to become a data-driven service leader to enable the national development agenda with its all encompassing work with all stakeholders (Bazaar, Samaj and Sarkar).',

There is a need to time communication and support to customers at times they require it most based on their daily routines. A robust system to segment, target and focus on each customer based on their needs from time to time is needed for India Post to direct its service force to make efforts in response to such needs." Background: The Department of Posts has implemented various Post Office Savings Bank (POSB) Schemes in All over India uniformly. However, each socio-geographic formation at the state, district, block and village level has its own demographic realities that require a customised thrust for making the relevant financial and insurance services available to the served population around each post office.  For example,  in West Bengal, there are some villages where percentage of females are higher where if Melas for Sukanya Samriddhi Accounts ( SSA) and Mahila Samriddhi Samman Patras (MSSC) can be arranged, the effectiveness of the sales effort and the conversion rate will be higher. Similarly, in some villages the number of senior citizens are higher and higher  number of Senior Citizen Social Security (SCSS) accounts can be opened for their benefit to justify presence of post offices in these areas. But there is no such report from where it can be identified, where and when the need of which product is higher. All melas like SSA, MSSC, Postal Life Insurance (PLI) , Rural Postal Life Insurance ( RPLI)  have been arranged in villages without the knowledge of percentage of male/female/child and senior citizens resulting in moderate to mediocre success for the efforts.  \nDescription: The Department of Posts has implemented various POSB Schemes in All over India uniformly. Actual demographic location-wise population is to be identified. In West Bengal, for example, there are some villages where percentage of females are higher, in some villages the number of senior citizens are higher. In some sectors demand young generation and service holders are much higher. The need of the youth and service holders are very different from the demands of other sector of people. Density of farmers and business-oriented people are higher in some areas.  All melas like SSA, MSSC, Public Provident Fund (PPF), Recurring Deposits (RD), Time Deposit ( TD)  PLI, RPLI have been arranged in every city and villages without the knowledge of percentage of male/female/child/senior citizens and other sectors of people and as a result the success of all the melas are found not satisfactory. \nExpected Solution: The expected solution is pictorial data and actual demographic and economic location-wise population is to be identified.  The demographic and location-wise population data is to be taken as a fundamental data towards improvement of financial (banking & insurance) services.',

          "1562 Solution for end-to-end tracking of dual use chemicals used in both legitimate industries and illicit drug production from point of manufacture to point of end use/export. Background: Dual use precursor chemicals are substances that have legitimate industrial and commercial applications but can also be used in the illicit manufacture of drugs. For e.g. Opium is converted to Heroin using Acetic Anhydride and manufacturing of Methamphetamine is done using Ephedrine or Pseudoephedrine. Precursor chemicals are essential in various legal industries such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, manufacturing etc., but their potential for misuse necessitates strict regulation and monitoring. Appreciating this, Government of India has put different levels of regulations on some of the precursor chemicals in India under the Regulation of Controlled Substances Order, 2013. 7 widely misused precursor chemicals are put under strictest of the controls, where in any firm dealing in any of these 7 chemicals are required to maintain records and file quarterly reports with jurisdictional NCB Zonal Unit. Any activity undertaken with respect to these chemicals like manufacture, possession, storage, sale, purchase, distribution, export, consumption etc are to be reported to NCB. Further, NCB also issues Unique Registration Number (URN) to the firms indulged in the said activities. If any individual or firm is found to be involved in any of the activities without a valid URN are punishable under the Narcotic Drugs and Controlled Substances Act, 1985.\nDescription: It is observed that some of the firms with valid URN to be handling any of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemical, divert the same from licit channel and traffic it for manufacturing of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. Further, the investigations conducted also reveal that the firms usually create documentation of the movement of precursor to a licit firm for a licit activity and divert the same for illicit activities. Therefore, there is a need for end-to-end tracking of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemicals (controlled substances)\nExpected Solution: A hardware/software/chemical solution for end-to-end tracking of dual use chemicals used in both legitimate industries and illicit drug production from point of manufacture to point of end use/export",

          "1649 DDoS Protection System for Cloud: Architecture and Tool Background:\nMany organization are using Cloud for hosting their web applications. The attackers can try to attack these webservers for achieving Denial of Service attack. Specifically, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network of Cloud infrastructure by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems assources of attack traffic.\nExploited machines can include computers and other networked resources. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate security tools to counter and protect against these attacks.\n\n• Description:\nThe most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is that a website or service suddenly becomes slow or unavailable. But since a number of causes such a legitimate spike in traffic can create similar performance issues, further\ninvestigation is usually required. Therefore, suitable analytics tools need to be developed to clearly identify an attack as DDoS.\nFollowing are some of the patterns for a DDoS attack:\n1. Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range\n2. A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version\n3. An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint\n4. Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes)\nThere are other, more specific signs of DDoS attack that can vary depending on the type of attack. The tool developer should be creative to consider other signs also.\nFor the above problem statements, following assumptions can be made:\n1. Cloud is hosting a website and providing some services to its users.\n2. The website should be always up and providing services to its users (high availability).\n3. The attackers can flood the website directly or via other nodes (DDoS).\n4. The attacker can also sabotage the link between a client and webserver.\n5. The attack can come from outside or from within the cloud infrastructure.\nA solution needs to be built by suitably designing the cloud architecture and developing some tool (s) to automatically detect and recover from the DDoS attack.\n\nExpected Solution:\nA set of developed tool(s) along with a suitable Cloud architecture to be demonstrated. The demonstrated website should be protected well against different types of DDoS attack. In case of an attack, the developed security tools\nshould be able to automatically detect and protect a website hosted on cloud infrastructure against DDoS attacks. The solution should also demonstrate the automatic recovery from the attack. As high availability is an essential feature, the down time (recovery time) should be minimized to the extent possible.",

Background:\nIn today’s digital age, a wide variety of services and processes take place online. Users of these digital facilities are required to upload government-issued containing documents or provide data for successfully availing the services. However, the uploaded documents or data which are required to facilitate these digital services and processes contain personally identifiable information (PII), i.e. any data that can be used to identify an individual uniquely. These documents can be like Aadhaar card, PAN, Credit Card, Driving License etc and can include data like names, address, phone number, email address, and financial information, among others of the user. The handling of PII is crucial as its exposure can lead to privacy breaches, identity theft, and financial fraud among other cyber related issues.\nDetailed Description:\nThe above problem statement envisages that an application be developed to identify whether PII, in the form of government-issued documents such as Aadhaar, Driving license, MHA-issued ID Cards, etc. is embedded in the uploaded document or provided data. Notable, the PII may be included inadvertently as well. PII, by its nature, is sensitive data, and its exposure must be protected against in order to safeguard users’ privacy. Entities and organizations handling documents or data containing users’ PII must be mindful of the complex challenges that arise with it – they have to balance data storage, encryption, access controls, data retention policies, data management processes with users’ knowledge and consent, notification of breaches by users, grievance redressal, etc. Such an application will aid in alerting individual users to verify whether it is necessary to upload or provide PII-containing document. Simultaneously, it will allow the personal data processing entity to check whether such PII document or data is required, and in case not necessary, help in removing, redacting or masking the PII\ndocument or data from the uploaded or provided document or alerting the individual user regarding the same. This application would be useful for the purposes of data protection compliance, risk mitigation, enhanced security, improved data quality, operational efficiency, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nExpected Solution:\nA software application or library package to detect and alert users when there is personally identifiable information (PII) related to identified government-issued identification documents (Aadhaar card, PAN, Driving License to start with) embedded in the uploaded documents or providing data, while uploading or reviewing. In addition, the software application may be placed in public domain and shall allow the receiver of the document in removing, redacting or masking the PII from the document and data, if required.",

Background:\n Critical Sector organisations uses a number of IT and OT equipment (e.g. Networking and hardware device, Operating Systems, Applications, Firmware etc.). These devices/application come with vulnerabilities from time to time. There should be timely information sharing mechanism by which the concerned equipment users at critical sector orgs should be altered regarding any critical / high severity vulnerabilities in their equipment within the shortest possible time.\n Detailed description:\n The ICT components (HW/SW) being used by Critical Sector Organisations become vulnerable from time to time. These vulnerabilities can be categorised as Critical, High, Medium and Low. Any exploitation of these vulnerabilities can cause havoc in multiple Critical Sector Organisations where such vulnerable equipment are being used.\n Keeping in view of the above, there is a need to monitor all such vulnerability information published at the equipment’s OEM websites and also other relevant websites. Once a critical or high severity vulnerability information is published at OEM website or any other relevant website, the ‘to be developed scrapper’ will immediately take that vulnerability input along with possible mitigating strategy published in the website and send the information to predefined email id(s).\n Note: The NVD website publishes such OEM vulnerable information. But the same comes with a time lag. It is therefore needed to get such information directly from OEM websites and /or from other relevant websites where such vulnerable information is published almost in real time.\n Expected Outcome:\n An automatic script using open source tools to be developed for the OEM vulnerability information scrapping and reporting. Tool should know various vulnerability information published data formats/syntax at OEM websites (both for IT and OT hardware and application) and come up with optimum solution for monitoring and reporting of such vulnerability information.\n \n The output of the tool that will be emailed to pre-designated email id(s) is as per following (shared with example; all fields may not be available at the time of reporting):\n * Product Name: Chrome\n * Product Version: - NA\n * OEM name: Google\n * Severity Level (Critical/High): High\n * Vulnerability: The N-able PassPortal extension before 3.29.2 for Chrome inserts sensitive information into a log file.\n * Mitigation Strategy: Install patch from https://me.n-able.com/s/security-advisory/aArHs000000M8CCKA0/cve202347131-passportal-browser-extension-logs-sensitive-data\n * Published Date: Jan 2024\n * Unique ID: CVE-2023-47131",

          "1678 RE-DACT Background: Easy to use and secure redaction tool “RE-DACT” which allows redaction/masking/anonymization on various input formats based on a gradational scale defined by the user and providing customized output. Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format.\nDescription: The proposed solution is a natural language processing (machine learning) based redaction tool. The tool will redact or obfuscate from original data leaving the output structurally/logically the same but stripped of key identifiers and other content which may in any way allow the identity, actual data, markers or issues in the input content to be revealed. The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems.\nThe degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities. User will have complete control over the input data.\nIt is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice.\nDeclassification processes are long and arduous; anonymization is largely manual or custom script driven. By providing a gradational redaction option, ordinary users can strip away the specificity to the extent of liking-from merely name removal/anonymization to completely synthetic data with only faint traces of original structure/pattern. This can allow generation of large number of databases with realistic but anonymized data that can be shared for learning, growth and commercial ventures.\nExpected Solution:\nProblem Statement: Easy to use and secure redaction tool “RE-DACT” which allows redaction/masking/anonymization on various input formats based on a gradational scale defined by the user and providing customized output.

        Description:
          "1746 Improving open source software security using Fuzzing Background: Fuzzing is an automated process of identifying software vulnerabilities by supplying unexpected and faulty inputs to the software. The main aim of fuzzing is to identify the crucial edge cases where a software might fail. Therefore, fuzzing provides a crucial insight into the stability and security of the software. The process of fuzzing can be divided into following broad steps –\n1. Identification of Target Function(s) – Target function(s) are typically those functions that act as entry points for processing input data. They use various APIs to perform operation on the input data.\n2. Developing harness – Harnesses are small code stubs whose sole purpose is to invoke the target function by using mutated data inputs. A harness bridges the gap between how the fuzzer generates input and how the target application receives and processes the input.\n3. Fuzzing - In this step, a fuzzer is used to generate numerous data inputs which are then passed to the target function using the harness. The fuzzer checks whether the application crashes by processing a certain input. If a crash occurs, then it saves the input and the memory state of the crash to file for later analysis.\nDescription:\nFuzzing has proven its effectiveness in discovering thousands of vulnerabilities in file-processing and stateless applications. In fuzzing, and automated testing in general, designing test oracles is crucial. In this challenge the team is supposed to fuzz an open source software namely the Windows variant of Sumatra PDF Reader software (version 3.5.2 or later). Sumatra PDF Reader is a very popular open source and widely used PDF viewing software. In this challenge, teams are required to develop a working harness for fuzzing of the latest version (version 3.5.2 or later) of Windows Sumatra PDF Reader software solution, fuzzed on any fuzzer of their choice.\nThe submission will be evaluated on the following criteria –\n1. Target functions identified\n2. Live demonstration of fuzzing harness developed\n3. Code Coverage achieved\n4. Technical report submitted by the team.\nExpected Solution: Each team must provide a fuzzing harness that is capable of fuzzing the windows software solution of the Sumatra PDF Reader (version 3.5.2 or later). This fuzzing harness must identify target functions and supply appropriate arguments for the invocation of such functions. The fuzzing harness will be run using a fuzzer (preferably WinAFL). Each team must submit a working harness along with a technical report stating –\n1. Reversing steps undertaken\n2. Target functions identified\n3. Dependencies identified",

          "1749 Recovery of Deleted Data and Associated Metadata from XFS and Btrfs Filesystems Background : Digital evidence has become increasingly crucial in forensic investigations. The recovery of deleted data from storage devices is essential for reconstructing timelines, identifying suspects, and uncovering critical information. Traditional file systems like FAT and NTFS have been extensively studied, and tools for recovering deleted data from them are relatively mature. However, modern file systems like XFS and Btrfs, designed for performance and reliability, employ complex data structures that pose signifycant challenges for data recovery.\nForensic investigations often involve recovering various file types, including documents files, log files, and system files. These files contain valuable information about system activities, user behaviour, and potential criminal activities. The ability to recover deleted files along with their complete metadata, such as creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, is crucial for establishing timelines and corroborating evidence.\nDetailed Description :XFS and Btrfs file systems offer advanced features like journaling, copy-on-write, and efficient data allocation. While these features enhance system performance and data integrity, they also complicate the process of recovering deleted data. When a file is deleted in these file systems, the data itself is not immediately erased; instead, the file system marks the allocated blocks as free for reuse. This delayed overwriting of data presents an opportunity for recovery, but it also requires specialized techniques to extract and analyse the deleted data.\nMoreover, recovering accurate metadata associated with deleted files is equally challenging. Metadata is critical for establishing the context of the recovered data and determining its relevance to the investigation. Extracting metadata from XFS and Btrfs file systems requires a deep understanding of their internal structures and data allocation mechanisms.\nExpected Solution: An ideal solution would be a comprehensive data recovery technique specifically designed for XFS and Btrfs file systems. These techniques should able to:\n1. Efficiently recover deleted data: Develop algorithms and techniques to identify and extract deleted files from the complex data structures of XFS and Btrfs.\n2.

Extract complete metadata: Recover accurate creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, file names, and other essential metadata associated with deleted files.\n4. Provide user-friendly interface: Offer an intuitive interface (GUI/CLI) for easily navigate recovered data and generate reports.\n5.

          "1739 Building Integrated Photo-voltaic (BIPV) potential assessment and visualisation using LOD-1 3D City Model Description: Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems are the solar power generating products or systems that are seamlessly integrated into the building envelop. The satellite data from Indian Satellites such as Cartosat-2/3 and Cartosat-1 are capable of generating 3D city models up to LoD-1. These LoD1 models, which are derived by extruding a footprint to a uniform height, can be used for simulating building shadows. This project aims to develop an interactive application for assessing BIPV potential using LOD-1 3D city model. It will involve simulating shadow of adjoining buildings on each face of the building and estimating incident solar energy on the vertical face of the building. The application will render the building surface according to available BIPV potential.\n Challenge:\n * 3D Visualisation of LOD-1 City Model\n * Simulating Building Shadows in 3D\n * 3D Rendering of BIPV Potential on Building\n Usage: Application of Space-based inputs for Renewable Energy\n Users: The application will be deployed on VEDAS portal's '3D City Model and Rooftop Solar Potential' application. It will be usefu for Policy-makers (State & Central Government), Solar Energy Solution Providers, Architects and citizens.\n Available Solutions (if Yes, reasons for not using them): Commercial Architectural Packages like Autodesk are suitable for building-level analysis and require substantial level of details. 3D GIS packages such as ESRI City Engine or Cesium provide visualisation capabilities. \n Software for city-wide BIPV potential estimation are currently not available in public domain.\n Desired Outcome: An interactive application where user provides a date (for calculating sun-position) and daily Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI) value, and the application generates corresponding 3D city model rendered according to incident solar energy for that day. The application also provide total BIPV and rooftop PV energy potential available in the building.",

        Description:
          "1658 Development of a versatile and fast algorithm for the optimal ship routing Background: Most of the goods are transported around the world by shipping which relies heavily on fossil fuels for powering. Given the expenditure of the shipping industry on the fuel, a main objective of a shipping company is to optimize the ship route for the least fuel consumption. Depending on the type and purpose of the voyage, it is also desirable to optimize several other parameters such as, the travel time, passenger comfort and route safety, to avoid any damage to the ship, cargo, crew and passengers. Optimization of each of these parameters serves a purpose. For instance, an energy efficient route may not be safe in terms of weather. Therefore, to avoid loss of life and property, route weather safety needs to be considered. An application suggesting the optimal route based on the chosen set of optimal parameters for any voyage between two ports in the Indian Ocean, will immensely benefit the Indian shipping industry.\nDescription: At the heart of any optimal ship routing application lies the optimization algorithm. Although scientific literature is available on various methods of optimizing the ship routes, given the commercial potential, there are no applications available publicly which can be customized for the Indian Ocean region. The optimization methods reported in literature range in complexity, computation time, versatility, etc. Various factors, such as, the forcings (surface winds, currents and waves), design of the ship and ship drift characteristics, impact the ship’s motion at sea. The optimal route must be continually evolving because the weather conditions keep changing as a ship proceeds on its voyage. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a suitable optimization method that can optimize several parameters for a range of ships (with varying type, dimensions, drift characteristics of a ship) and develop an algorithm to return an optimal route within a reasonable computational time. The algorithm can optimize for the voyage time and safety to begin with but with a scope for addition of more optimization parameters. To get an idea of the problem, please visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct9v-mQgYqE ii) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCTdHRTWtNI \nExpected Solution: Identification of a versatile optimization method and development of a reasonably fast algorithm, preferably written in an open-source programming language such as Python",

Commercial trucks of 5-14 tonnes capacity ply on these routes carrying parcels and mail. There are also state or intra-circle routes operated through a combination of commercial and departmental trucks for carrying parcels and mail. \nDescription: The RTN trucks, operating on various routes, touch intermediate points, where parcels and mail are off-loaded and loaded. The capacity utilization of the trucks fluctuates depending upon the volume of parcels/mail being carried by it [illustration: On the Ahmedabad-Ajmer-Jaipur route, Ahmedabad loads the truck up to 80% capacity for Ajmer. At Ajmer, 20 % of the volume is offloaded, and 30% loaded, bringing total loading to 90% capacity (80-20+30 = 90). Similarly, at Jaipur, 40% volume is offloaded and 50 % loaded, bringing total loading to 100% (90-40+50= 100)]. Real time data is required for optimal utilization of truck capacity and adequate planning. In order to monetize spare capacity, integration with 3PL partners for capacity sharing through API (as described in the previous point) is also required. \nRTN trucks traverse a fixed route with specific touch points. The trucks may be delayed due to various factors, such as vehicle breakdown, poor traffic conditions, detours, detention at one or more touch points etc. GPS, geofenced locking should be enabled for any detours or delays so that alerts may immediately be triggered for verification and corrective action in time. Live tracking of trucks, with points of delay is required for efficient and timely movement of parcels and mail in the value chain. \nThere should be a system for dispatch and schedule management as per live data automatically populated and analyzed in real time. Any changes or deviations should automatically flow into the system so that schedules, which are downstream, automatically get updated and adjusted to the delay in real time. \nAll data should be captured and populated automatically, and relevant MIS reports generated automatically with visualization where relevant. \nExpected Solution: As described above the expected solution is based of GPS leading to a strong GIS for the network for it to send alerts and prompt necessary adjustments on the interlinked parts of the supply chain for every run of the truck.",

PIOs still take/use Indian Products such as Puja Samagri/Traditional Attires/ Handicrafts. Most of them are dependent on e-commerce platform. Through this they cannot be assured of the quality of the products they get and transportation cost may also be very high. Secondly local sellers/small handicrafts artisans who are the actual manufacturers are not able to ship high quality products because of limited resources and information at their disposal. Hence there is a need to connect the Indian Community abroad with the local artisans.\nDescription: In order to overcome this issue an application is required through which one can go to a particular local seller as per their preference and should be able to onboard the seller as well. The following data points may be required to be integrated in the said Application.\n1.        Global Indian Diaspora Data on the basis of their needs namely – Income/\n Financial data, Consumption pattern and buying behavior pattern.\n2.      There should be Buyer and Seller Registration so that Quality Assurance and standard Transit Cost can be ensured.\n3.

The Post Office also merges Pincodes together to mechanise and streamline delivery in the emerging volume and mix of mail handled at different stages, including the point of delivery. An intelligent solution, powered by AI is needed to meet the dynamic design of the supply chain both for customers as well as operators within India Post. Background: The Department of Post in India boasts the world's largest postal network, with over 165,000 post offices. Through nearly 19,000 pin codes across the country the postal network manages the delivery of postal items across its network. One common issue is the mismatch between the specified Delivery Post Office name and the area PIN code on mail items, leading to delays and customer dissatisfaction.The delivery network design keeps on evolving as Nodal Delivery Centres and Delivery Hubs are introduced to bring in more efficiency in operations. From the perspective of the customer, the challenge is two fold: (a)  to know the correct Pin Code, which is itself a challeng; (b) the dynamic nature of operations inside with merged pin codes etc for all or certain categories of mail is also a challenge. Though the customer does not need to bother about (b), the internal system of India Post needs to take care of both issues (a) and (b) for efficient and correct delivery at all times.    \nDescription: Postal services are essential for various government, financial, educational, corporate, and public entities, both in urban and rural areas. Despite the widespread use of postal services, inaccurate addressing persists, hampering efficient delivery. Each mail item must clearly indicate the recipient's Delivery Post Office name and area Pin Code. However, inconsistencies in this information often result in misrouted mail, with approximately 5% of articles handled daily at distribution hubs containing incorrect Pin Codes. Even if correct Pincodes are provided as per information available with the customer, there is a mismatch in the internal operations as the constant upgradation of delivery network with Nodal Delivery Centres with merged pincodes etc makes it too dynamic for internal operators to keep pace with the changes. This leads to mistakes, delays and wasteful movement of mail pieces in the system. \nExpected Solution: An AI-based scanning solution is proposed to identify the correct delivery location for mail items with unclear or mismatched addresses. This system will utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret address information, determining the appropriate Delivery Post Office based on available data. By automating the identification process, this solution aims to improve last-mile delivery efficiency, reducing delays and enhancing customer satisfaction. Having taken care of the first problem, the system is also expected to align with internal operational databases for clubbing and mapping of different pincodes for delivery purpose and thereby suggest the right destination for dispatch and delivery of the articles.",

E-commerce organisations like Amazon,Flipkart, financial organisations like ICICI, HDFC etc are providing door step products/services with use of advanced technology like digital platform or machine learning through AI. This creates another level of acceptance across the world among the recipient for the organisation. This is becoming part of basic customer expectation and needs to be included in the Department’s common value proposition with the help of a robust system tied to its operational system. \nDescription: India Post as the largest mail delivery organisation in India delivers articles/parcels at the door step of customer. The delivery is one of the key services the Department offers to the citizens of India. Department reaches last mile of delivery through its branches. The delivery process initiates at the booking Post office after receiving mails/articles. After sorting, the concerned Postman of the delivery Post Office has to reach to the recipient for delivering article mostly during the office hours, i.e. in between 10am to 5pm. In many instances, recipient cannot receive the article within that time range of the delivery due to his absence at the delivery address. In that case i) Post man either has to make 2nd attempt or next day delivery which falls within same time range orii) after unsuccessful delivery Postman has to serve intimation for next day delivery or for window delivery at Post Office by the recipient personally. In both cases, wastage of valuable working hours of the Postman happens for sure. Moreover, due to such incident, recipient has to take leave from his/her work as delivery time range/slot gets coincided with his/her working hours for collecting the article. In many cases article gets returned to sender because of non-availability of the addressee within time range of Postman delivery.\nThis creates dissatisfaction on the delivery service among both Sender and Receiver of the article/consignment, thus lowering departmental performance index. Hence Department is losing the extra mile of delivery performance in the eye of customer of modern era as well as e-commerce like product oriented organizations who uses last mile unique delivery system of this organisation.\nExpected Solution: -\nAt time of booking of any consignment sender should have option to select time slot for delivery and share the same with the recipient which can be modified by the sender online at any point of time before the date of delivery.\nWhenever recipient will receive sms/alert about the consignment to be delivered at his/her end with the mentioned time slot, the recipient should have the option/flexibility to make change of time slot online before the day of delivery.\nInitially such data will create training data for AI which will develop a reference frame of time slot for sender and also for delivery person of department for timely and customer friendly future delivery of article for same recipient.\nLast mile of delivery information will become integral part of booking which will help both consignment movement across the country and effective delivery.',

Consequently, philatelists from other circles often find it challenging to obtain such material. Additionally, there is a lack of awareness regarding ancillary releases among the philatelic community nationwide.\nDescription:\nTo address these issues, the development of a comprehensive website dedicated to philately, which would serve as a centralized platform for philatelists across India is the prospective solution suggested.  This website would facilitate the creation of a National Philately Deposit Account, enabling philatelists to access philatelic material released pan India. Other supporting mechanisms to strengthen the community can also be thought of and integrated to the main solution. \nExpected Solution:\nThe proposed website would offer the following features:\nCentralized Platform: The website would display philatelic material released by all postal circles across India, ensuring that philatelists have access to a wide range of items.\nOnline Ordering and Payment: Philatelists would be able to order and pay for philatelic material online through the website, streamlining the purchasing process and eliminating geographical barriers.\nStandard Postal Services: Postage for ordered items would be charged at the standard rates for Registered/ Speedpost services, ensuring reliable and efficient delivery.\n Cancellation Releases: Information regarding cancellation releases would be made available on the website, allowing philatelists to obtain cancellations on postal stationery through the website. Rates for such services can be determined accordingly.',

Background:\nGreen hydrogen, produced from renewable energy sources, offers a game-changing solution for decarbonization. Unlike its fossil fuel counterpart, green hydrogen emits no greenhouse gasses at the point of use, making it ideal for hard-to-electrify sectors like heavy industry, long-distance transport, and steel production. This clean fuel can power vehicles and industrial processes, slashing emissions and combating climate change. Furthermore, green hydrogen's potential for energy storage allows for a more balanced and resilient renewable energy grid. As we strive for a net-zero future, green hydrogen is a crucial tool for a cleaner and more sustainable tomorrow.\n\nDescription:\nGreen hydrogen's potential for clean energy is undeniable. However, its widespread adoption faces a significant roadblock: high levelized cost. This cost, encompassing production, storage, and transportation, makes green hydrogen less competitive compared to traditional fossil fuels. This disparity discourages industries from switching to green alternatives. Government incentives, technological advancements, and economies of scale are all crucial to bridge this cost gap. Only then can green hydrogen fulfil its promise as a transformative force in the fight against climate change.\n\nExpected Solution:\nThe Project details should include definitive inputs on:\nSizing of production capacity.\nProduction technology, useful life, replacement costs etc.\nProposed RTC-RE model (if production is through electrolysers).\nProposed sourcing of Feedstock\nExpected plant CUF.\nEntire Financial Model with detailed breakup for CAPEX & OPEX.\nStorage technologies used (with compliance of safety standards) and their cost.\nApproaches used to lower levelized cost during project modelling.\nPolicy and Regulatory support required.\nScope for further cost optimisation through economies of scale.",

          "1576 Reducing the carbon emissions from thermal plants, developing ways of Carbon capture and utilisation through value added products Background:\nCoal is the most important and abundant fossil fuel in India. It accounts for 55% of the country's energy need. The country's industrial heritage was built upon indigenous coal. Our countries major production of Electricity is achieved through coal fired thermal power plant which is around 3/4th of the total power generation and also the biggest source of Carbon emission. India updated its NDC according to which the target: To reduce emissions intensity of its GDP has been enhanced to 45% by 2030 from 2005 level. India's also creating energy transition pathway to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to reduce the effects of climate change and promote sustainability. However, owning to energy security issue the role of coal cannot be ruled out in immediate future till various storage solution gets mature and become available at affordable cost.\n\nDescription:\nCarbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) is a promising technology that can help India meet its energy security and emission reduction goals. CCUS can be retrofitted to existing power and industrial plants, allowing for their continued operation. CCS was acknowledged as a solution for climate mitigation by IPCC. However, IPCC also noted that CCS has the highest cost and lowest possible contribution to net emission reduction in both energy and industry sectors. This problem is having potential opportunity for innovators, researchers and start-ups. In order to meet the 1.5°C goal, IPCC projects the need to have technical geological storage of about 1,000 GtCO2. However, the availability of geological storage is highly location dependent and there are several technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and socio-cultural barriers to implementing CCS, according to IPCC.\n\nExpected Solution:\nLow cost solution with indigenous technology development for carbon capture and utilisation.\nDeveloping solution for storage and transport of carbon which is more sustainable ecologically and environmentally\nConverting CO2 into value-added products, creating economic value from waste products and contributing to the circular carbon economy, building construction materials, fuels & chemicals and carbon nano-materials.",

Consequently, it is essential to design controllers for solar trackers that can optimize the angle of incidence between solar panels and sunlight. This tracking of the sun’s trajectory can be done accurately by managing at least one mechanical axis (azimuth, elevation, roll). As a preliminary step, a simulation-based control system, using tools such as SimscapeTM MultibodyTM and Simulink®, can be designed with a single-axis control based on location-specific solar paths. The workflow would involve integrating an electrical motor model (developed using tools like SimscapeTM ElectricalTM), designing a PID control system, developing an algorithm for optimal axis positioning, and validating the system through simulation. In the subsequent steps after validation, the motor control system can be deployed on low-cost hardware (e.g., using Simulink® Support Package for Arduino) to demonstrate a prototype of this solar tracking mechanism.\nReferences: \n1.

This lack of awareness often leads to inefficient application, reduced crop yield, and potential environmental issues due to over or under-application. Accurately measuring the nutrient content of F/L OM is essential for optimizing its use and ensuring sustainable agricultural practices. However, existing solutions are often expensive and complex, making them inaccessible to small farmers.\n \n Expected Solution: The development of low-cost, easy-to-use kits that can accurately measure the nutrient content of F/L OM. These kits should be affordable for small farmers and provide reliable data on the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other essential nutrients.

          "1571 Drone-based Intelligent ET sensing system and irrigation water use accounting system for irrigation commands. Background: The use of Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) technology for estimation of seasonal Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) of crops at various growth stages is well establishd. Due to low levels of water metering in irrigation, it is challenging to control theft from canals and unauthorized ground water extractions. Therefore, ET based technologies can enforce water accounting / auditing and thus enhance Water Use Efficiency (WUE). \nHowever, the EOS based ET technology has certain limitations i.e. low accuracy under cloudy conditions and low resolutions. Therefore, the drone-based ET systems can be used to bridge this data gap. \nDescription: The idea is to estimate the actual water consumption by the crops (i.e. AET) in a targeted irrigated command area (ranging from 50 Ha to 5000 Ha) with the help of a drone based system. This system should have a portable drone control module along with an in-built Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI&ML) mechanism to work out AET and calibrate against the satellite-based ET inputs. Once integrated with cadastral maps, it should be tailored for individual farm level water control. \nExpected Solution: A drone fitted with suitable ET sensing system to bridge the data gaps/limitations from Satellite based ET system for calculation of Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) of different crops under survey. The AI&ML algorithm using historical data and satellite based inputs should be able to give various Key Performance Indicators (KPI) at farm level like (i) Type of Crop; (ii) Crop monitoring (seeding/sowing/harvest/ disease etc); (iii) Water Auditing/Water Accounting: (iv) Over irrigated vs under irrigated/Ground water use; etc. \nThese KPI's can provide an insight of farmer irrigation decision-making; estimation of irrigation water use; farmer irrigation behavior heuristics and management practices, including the scheduling and efficiency of irrigation decisions. The software model can be polished over time in different irrigation commands to improve the accuracy and reliability of irrigation water use estimation. This will give a complete control of water use and agriculture productivity at field through remote sensing and help in increasing the Groundwater Level in critical unsafe areas.",

          "1606 Micro-Doppler based Target Classification Description: The world today has bought on a need to pay increased attention to safety and security issues, for example, search and rescue operations, surveillance, and protection of critical infrastructure. These tasks are often labour intensive and potentially dangerous. This provides an incentive to create systems that aid operators to gain situational awareness. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles, pose a significant threat to privacy and security. To understand and assess this threat, classification between different drone models and types is required. One way in which this has been demonstrated experimentally is through this use of micro-Doppler information from radars. Normally birds and drones are often confused and there is need for a method which clarifies their corresponding class.\nBackground: Due to substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. Drone and birds both include micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wing beats respectively. These distinctive features can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately.\nDetailed Description:\nClassification of drones and non-drones using micro-Doppler signatures captured from Radar as a sensor. Moving parts of an object produce modulated Doppler components called micro-Doppler. The modulated Doppler signature is presented as added components to the Doppler signature of the drone body. Due to rotating blades, frequency modulated components, which are quite revealing, are produced. To observe the time varying micro-Doppler’s, received FMCW should be processed by Joint time-frequency analysis.\nA Conventional air surveillance radar system(operating usually at L-Band or S-Band) can rely on the radar cross section(RCS) of an aircraft for detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection in case of drones. Even if a dedicated system is built to be sensitive enough to detect small object like a drone, just RCS information is not adequate. Birds have similar physical size to drones and also will fly at similar altitude and speeds. A reliable drone detection radar system must have the capability to discriminate between a drone and a bird. And hence micro-Doppler signature analysis is the key parameter for classification.\nExpected Solution:\nInput: The micro-Doppler signatures of drones and bird\nOutput: Class of the object(Drone or Bird)",

          "1561 Affordable, Sustainable, and User-friendly Solutions for Semen Dose Storage and Distribution Background: lndia has emerged as leading milk producer country in the world, however productivity of dairy animals is very low. To improve the productivity of animals a major focus area is to breed these animals using semen from high genetic merit bulls through Artificial lnsemination (Al). Al enables farmers to access the best bull (male) genetics. Farmers can improve the production, health traits, fertility and longevity of their dairy cattle by using a balanced approach to breeding. Animal health is also improved through the use of Al.\nDescription: For Al, the semen is inseminated into the female by placing a portion of it either in a collected or diluted form into the cervix or uterus by mechanical methods at the proper time and under most hygienic conditions. Ensuring the integrity of the cold chain from Semen Production centres to the farmer's destination, where semen is utilized for artificial insemination, is crucial for the effective functioning of the Al delivery\nsystem in lndia.\nSemen doses are currently stored and transported using liquid nitrogen and specialized containers. However, significant losses of liquid nitrogen occur during storage and transportation, leading to escalated costs for maintaining the cold chain. The cost of liquid nitrogen itself is an issue. Mishandling of liquid nitrogen poses potential health hazards. The bulky and heavy nature of liquid nitrogen storage containers necessitates considerable resou rces for transportation.\nExpected solution:\n. There is a need to explore and promote alternative, cost-effective, and long-lasting methods for the storage and transportation of semen doses\n. The design, material, type of insulation of storage containers can also help in cost effectiveness, reduction in losses, compactness and ease of carrying to facilitate efficient distribution.",

          "1560 Rapid colorimetric and artificial intelligence-based methods for determining the microbial quality of raw milk, processed milk, and milk products Background:\nMilk is perishable product, it requires immediate processing after few hours (2-4Hrs) of production, otherwise, bacterial load increases and milk gets deteriorate. At present Methytene Blue Dye Reduction Test, commonly known as MBRT test is used as a quick method to assess the microbiological quality of raw and pasteurized milk. This test is based on the fact that the blue colour of the dye solution added to the milk get decolourized when the oxygen present in the milk get exhausted due to microbial activity. The sooner the decolourization, more inferior is\nthe bacteriological quality of milk assumed to be. This test is widely used at the dairy reception dock, processing units and milk chilling centres where it is followed as acceptance/rejection criteria for the raw and processed milk. Further, processed dairy products may also get spoiled in the supply chain for microbiological reasons.\nDescription: The above mentioned MBRT has to be done under sterile conditions. Take 10 ml milk sample in sterile MBRT test tube. Add 1 ml MBRT dye solution (dye concentration 0.005%). Stopper the tubes with sterilized rubber stopper and carefully place them in a test tube stand dipped in a serological water bath maintained at 37t1oC. Record this time as the beginning of the incubation period. Decolourization is considered complete when only a faint blue ring (about 5mm) persists at the top. However, for processed dairy products, the enumeration of bacterial load is time-consuming and requires different methods.\nExpected solution: The above mentioned MBRT takes 4 to 6 Hours for completion of the test. Therefore, it is proposed to develop cost effective, rapid and portable method/Machine to deduct microbial load in Raw and Pasteurized Milk as compared to present Methylene blue reduction test (MBRT).Meanwhile, smart packaging tools such as freshness indicators could be a solution for processed dairy products.ln this context, artificial intelligence, machine vision, systems, etc. could be explored.",

          "1580 Wearable sensor with Artificial Intelligence for prevention of falls in elderly people Background: As per the census 2011, Disability is more common in elderly people. One of the major reasons for disability among the elderly people is falls. Every year, one-third of community-dwelling older adults (adults aged 65 and older) experience a fall. Falls, defined as “unexpected event[s] in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level,” are responsible for a wide range of negative health outcomes. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults, and the age-adjusted fall death rate (64 deaths per 100,000 older adults) increased by 30%. Additionally, the psychological impact of falling can cause older adults and their caregivers significant fear about the risk of falling again. This fear of falling can have an accumulating effect whereby the fear of falling causes individuals to limit their everyday physical activities, which in turn makes them weaker and more susceptible to future falls. In fact, studies have shown that falling once doubles the chances of falling again. Many falls, however, can be prevented. One of the most effective ways to reduce fall risk is through targeted exercise that improves an individual’s strength, balance, and mobility\nDescription: Exercise-based programs, such as the Otago Exercise Program and Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance, have been shown to reduce falls by up to 35% and 55%, respectively. Until recently, however, the vast majority of fall prevention programs were only offered in small, in-person classes hosted in local senior centres or gyms. Although this has been the standard dissemination method for decades, it comes with significant barriers to participation. Common barriers to in-person programs include a lack of programs in rural or under resourced communities; limited or no access to transportation; scheduling conflicts; cost of getting to and using facilities; interpersonal barriers, such as finding other participants’ presence intimidating; and physical environmental barriers, such as bad weather, stairs, uneven ground, difficult parking, and more\nThe recent developments in Wearable technology with Artificial intelligence may help elderly people in preventing falls by giving tactile/visual/auditory feedback to users regarding risks of falling. This software may be developed with sensors that could able to sense whenever there is risk of Line of Gravity (LOG) goes outside the Base of Support (BOS) during day-to-day activities for elderly people as this is the commonest reason for elderly people.\nExpected Solution:\nThese technologies will help elderly people to prevent falling by which Disability may be prevented. This digital delivery of a fall prevention program may be feasible. This suggests that the digital program addresses a previously unmet need in the community and its delivery would be sufficient to engage the community dwellers",

          "1581 Development of cost-effective myoelectric prosthesis. Background: With the loss of an upper limb, activities of daily living (ADL) become more challenging for the affected person. Functional body powered upper limb prosthesis can replace the functions of upper limb for ADL activities up to some extent. But in higher level of upper limb amputation, it becomes difficult for the patient to manage ADL activities. The requirement of externally powered prosthesis such as myoelectric prosthesis plays a vital role in this aspect.\nDescription of Problem statement: \nA myoelectric prosthesis is an externally powered prosthesis which is controlled by muscle contraction (muscle action potential). In market, many variants of myoelectric prostheses are available with various features. The most important feature of these prostheses is the grasping pattern types and also it indicates about movement of different fingers in prosthesis. Because it is expensive, access to these high-end prosthesesbecomes challenging for patients with upper limb amputation living in developing nations like India. Even though few myoelectric prostheses are available in market with less cost, but the features are limited and are not working precisely. \nExpected Solutions: \nExperts from different disciplines, such as engineers for creating programs and fabrication of controlling circuits and Prosthetist for fabrication of sockets and fitment of the prostheses are required to design and develop a cost-effective myoelectric prosthesis. Most important feature of the prosthesis is the grasping pattern which is completely dependent on the prosthetic hand. Thus, design and fabrication of prosthetic hand also plays a vital role in the complete working mechanism of the prosthesis. Thus, to get a successful result, it is possible to work collaboratively with experts from different discipline.",

        Description:
          "1557 Development of Tyre Maintenance and Operation App, including fitment of necessary IIoT related hardware in Dumpers Tyre cost is one of the most important O&M cost in dumpers. In high capacity dumpers of CIL, the tyres are imported ones, and cost of such tyre is more than Rs. 25.00 lakhs each.\nTwo aspects are equally crucial for tyre management in a mine – The first is the proper assessment of TKPH, and the second is proper maintenance of tyre pressure. Besides these two aspects, proper tyre performance analysis is also important.\nTKPH: Tonne-Kilometer-Per-Hour\nIt is indicative of how much average load is carried by an individual tyre, for a given average speed condition, during an entire shift of operation.\nTKPH = (Mean load on tyre in tonne) x (AWSS in km/hour)\nWhere, Mean Load is the average load in empty condition and loaded condition, and AWSS is the Average Speed during the Work Shift.\nAssessing the correct TKPH requirement by the user for a particular mining condition is the most important task. The user has to seek a particular TKPH tyre from the manufacturer. Manufacturer accordingly manufactures and supplies the same TKPH tyre to the user, by using suitable tread pattern and tyre compound in its factory.\nMore is the TKPH, more heat-resistance the tyre will be. But if the TKPH is increased just to ensure heat-resistance, then it adversely affects the cut-resistance properties of the tyre. If operating TKPH is very very less than the designed TKPH of tyres, there will not be heat- failures, but cut-failures will increase. So, there should be a balance between the heat-resistance and cut-resistance properties, and proper assessment of TKPH is a must.\nActions required: The payload monitoring system has already been installed in CIL’s dumpers, and the payload as well as operating speed per shift is being continuously recorded in the Vehicle’s Productivity and Health Monitoring System. By using suitable IoT application and suitable app, the payload and speed data may be directly transferred and analysed through the suitable app, so that correct value of TKPH assessment may be made directly through the mobile app. This assessed TKPH will be very helpful in procurement of suitable tyres for a particular geo mining condition.\nTyre Pressure\nProper tyre pressure is equally important for tyre life. Incorrect tyre pressure adversely affects the fuel economy, as well as the performance of other vital systems of the vehicle, apart from creating safety issues also. In a big mine, regular checking of tyre pressure for all the dumpers remain a daunting task, and involves lot of time and manpower resources.\nExpected Solution: Suitable Tyre Pressure Sensors along with data transfer mechanism need to be installed in the dumpers, which can be used in real-time capturing of tyre pressure of all tyres fitted in the dumper. So, first of all necessary IIoT system along with hardware need to be fitted in the dumper. Next, appropriate application may be developed, to transfer the real-time tyre pressure data through the Mobile App. The real-time tyre pressure data may also be simultaneously displayed to the operator with suitable alarm system in case of low tyre pressure. In case of low tyre pressure, suitable alerts may be incorporated for Mobile App user. If such a system through Mobile App is controlled effectively by Maintenance team, they may not require to check each and every tyre pressure physically, rather they can directly identify the tyres which need immediate attention. This will help in optimum utilization of the tyre maintenance resources, and avoiding unnecessary downtime.\nTyre Performance Analysis\nApart from the above two aspects of tyres maintenance and operation, the Mobile App may also keep tyre-wise, its fitment position-wise records to properly assess the tyre performance and reasons of failures including premature failures, if any. Such provisioning in the App will automatically compute the individual tyre life obtained in a particular mine; and if linked to costing, it will automatically compute the cost/working hour of tyres.\nSuch analysis will go a long way in improving the tyre performance in CIL.",

Interactive exhibits are the lifeblood of science centers, but keeping them functioning smoothly can be a challenge. It poses the problem of regular maintenance. It has also been observed that defects remain unattended for long due to not being identified. It creates a genuine problem for the visitors\' experience and sometimes they are not aware of the optimum result. Here lines the requirement for an automated defective exhibit identification system.\nDescription:\nIt is a real-life problem in big Museum/ Science Museum/Centres, where there is inadequacy of manpower. Following are the problems in a nutshell that arose due to unnoticed and undiagnosed defects of the exhibits.\nHigh Maintenance Needs: Unlike static displays, interactive elements have more moving parts, software, and technology that require regular upkeep to function properly these are considered as ""golden parameters of any particular Exhibits"". Theses parameters are to be kept functional to keep the exhibits in a running condition.\nFrustration for Visitors: Encountering a non-functional exhibit can be frustrating for visitors, especially children, who may not understand why it\'s not working.\nMissed Learning Opportunities: Broken/ non-functional exhibits prevent visitors from fully engaging with the science concepts they\'re designed to teach.\nBecause of their complexity, malfunctions might not be immediately obvious to visitors or staff, leading to a broken experience. Also creates a bad impression for that particular gallery and ultimately to the science center or to Science Museums.\nExpected Solution:\nNow, with the emergence of artificial intelligence, it transpires that amalgamation of Al with automation may give efficient result to detect defective exhibits placed in the galleries and give the feedback to the concerned section for immediate repairing initiative and rectify the exhibits.

          "1624 To develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based model for electricity demand projection including peak demand projection for Delhi Power system Background:\nThe load profile of power requirement in NCT of Delhi is highly peculiar. We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand.\nDescription:\nThe peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs.\nFurther, the solar generation comes during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there is uneven load growth in the city, the upcoming areas are witnessing huge load growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State' Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and Slot-wise power is more expensive.\nExpected Solution:\nAn Artificial Intelligence based model be developed with suitable compensation methodology to factor the weather effects (like temperature humidity, and wind speed, rains/showers), public holidays/ weekly holidays, natural load growth, and real estate development.",

          "1655 Detecting oil spills at marine environment using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets Background: The impact of oil spills at sea is multifaceted, affecting the environment, economy, public health, and society at large. Preventing spills through stringent regulations, improved technology, and better safety practices is crucial to mitigate these devastating effects. Automatic oil spill detection using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets is essential for environmental protection, public health and safety, economic stability, regulatory enforcement, technological advancement, and operational efficiency. This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. \nDetailed description: \nThe automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel's unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. \nTo detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently. As far as study area, any of the below options may be considered.\nOption 1 : off Mumbai: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HUisEfMA20ilODdeoRYVneG2i1ZbRBNB/view?usp=drive_link\nOption 2 :Gulf of Mexico – North American waters: \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1_iEcojaZNaezOqKwxHtCenjgOW58lPgA/view?usp=drive_link\nExpected solution: Automated oil spill detection system for early detection of oil spills\nA software/tool/system to be developed for detecting oil spills/vessel in distress with suitable methodology that involves programming in python.

          "1657 Integrated Geo-Referenced Fish Catch Data Repository and Access System Background:\nINCOIS provides fishery advisory services to fishermen through potential fishing zone (PFZ) advisories that proven to benefit fishing communities by making fishing more economical and reducing fuel consumption, as fishermen can directly target areas with abundant fish. Current research is focused on advancing the fisheries forecasting services through developing species-specific advisory services. However, predicting species-specific abundance requires a deep understanding of the habitat suitability of commercially important species. This requires analyzing fish catch data alongside environmental variables at the locations of fish occurrence and abundance, identifying the most important variables contributing to their abundance, and ultimately fitting these data to appropriate prediction models. INCOIS is striving to collect geo-referenced fish catch data from various sources, including data from other research Institutions, industry collaborators, research cruises, and a dedicated app that captures fisheries information through images from fish catch locations. However, at present there is no systematic mechanism to aggregate and store these information from multiple channels to a single data base. As a result, the data is highly scattered and disaggregated, leading to wastage of time and confusion among scientific personnel developing species-specific habitat suitability models, since this disorganization makes it difficult to access all available datasets for analysis.\nDetailed Description:\nConsidering the difficulties in collecting georeferenced fish catch data, each single dataset is highly crucial for habitat suitability models. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive database to store all available georeferenced fish catch information with appropriate filters and visualization tools. This would enable dedicated personnel to easily access and download all data available for a particular species. Such a dataset would also be highly beneficial for new scientists interested in working on different species, resulting in species specific advisory services for more species in future. \nData input, classification and arrangement \nThe software solution for the portal should handle input data in Excel format and organize it by date, location, depth, and species. Some datasets provide the weight of individual species, while others are only the aggregate weight of the catch with only the information on presence of individual species, not their catch weights. Therefore, there should be separate modules for occurrence and abundance of species. The module for abundance should store data that includes catch weight of individual species, while the module for occurrence should store data with and without catch weight.\nUsers, Data output and visualization\nThe users of the portal will primarily be scientific personnel working on specific species or multiple species, interested in visualizing and downloading data for their target species. Therefore, the portal should display search results for a species using appropriate maps and graphical formats, and also allow users to download the data in Excel/CSV format with columns for Date, Species, Latitude, Longitude, Catch Weight, and Depth.\n-In some instances, scientific personnel may also be interested in studying the fish assemblage patterns of multiple species within a particular geographical area over time. Thus, the output filters should also allow users to filter data by area (using latitude and longitude bounds) and display the occurrences and abundances of all available species over different time scales, along with relevant data on their depth of occurrence.\nData Accessibility\nThe Data repository should have an admin page to continuously update the database, and users should be able to login with appropriate credentials to access the data.\nExpected Solution: A comprehensive data base to feed, arrange, store and visualize disaggregated data on fish catch. This would make research towards species-specific fisheries forecasts hassle-free and smooth, saving time and effort in collecting and compiling information, allowing researchers to focus on more productive tasks.",

It was also accepted that these SDGs are not possible to achieve without changing humanity’s relationship with the oceans. To realize that, in 2017, it was decided that the decade of 2021-30 is to be observed as UN Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (or UN Ocean Decade). INCOIS is identified as UN Ocean Decade Collaborative Centre for the Indian Ocean Region to help address all the ten UN Ocean Decade challenges (https://oceandecade.org/challenges/).\n\nDescription: The creative solution proposed herein will address mainly (but not limited to) challenge-10. The gamified way of creating ocean related awareness is aimed for all age-groups and diverse education levels. Considering popularity of online gaming (multi-role playing to conventional games such as ludo) and affordable devices along with data plans, this approach is promising option for ocean literacy. For a starter, one such solution (but very limited/basic in nature) can be found at: https://www.outreachgames.org/OceanProtector/main.html.\n\nExpected Solution:\nThe user will be able to chose from a variety of sea-going roles e.g. but not limited to, fishermen, captain of a ship, tourism operator etc. Based on the role, one needs to choose the correct sea conditions to be at a location (or move away) with the help of available/applicable ocean information services form INCOIS (simulated for the game). Correct decision (e.g. going for fishing to PFZ zone or moving away from the shore when tsunami is detected) will add to the points and help player achieve next level. Wrong decision may result in loosing points and add other gaming penalties (e.g. start over or wait till certain time etc etc). Users goal would be to advance and maintain gains at the daily, weekly etc leaderboards so in that way it would be competitive among the users even though their game decisions are not affecting to the others directly.\nThe solution should be suitable for windows and android environments (web and browser based) and scalable over the time by the host institute independently post-SIH",

UIDAI is exploring possibilities to enable Face authentication on the desktop in a browser context. The proposed architecture to provide Face\nAuthentication in the browser context,requires AI on the edge to perform liveness check of the face being captured by the webcam or connected camera. UIDAI is considering the injection of ML model by using an appropriate binary code delivery mechanism.\nThe security of these models is important for transaction integrity and therefore seeking an innovative solution that will protect the model from any tampering and\nreverse engineering.\n2. Problem Description. As part of the challenge, participating teams to demonstrate model security in a browser context by using either obfuscation or\ncryptography. Models are typically 5~7Mb in size and structured as flatbuffers. These models would be downloaded, when for the first time accessed on a desktop and then cached in the browser context. For subsequent face authentication transactions, a cached model would be preferred, unless otherwise the model has changed or updated.\nTo solve the above problem statement, teams are free to choose either ONNX web runtime or Tensor.js or any other innovative model to distribute the model in the\nbrowser context.\nThe proposed solution must meet the following functional objectives.\n1 Model Security. The solution must provide a mechanism to protect the model from any reverse engineering or tampering.\n2 Model Size Optimisation. The solution must not significantly increase the size of the model post-implementation of security frameworks. Models are\nexpected to be downloaded in 3G/4G/5G wireless networks and hence any increase in size may lead to deteriorated user experience.\n3 The solution must feature backend components to prepare the ML model either using obfuscation or cryptography. The backend activity can be a one-time\ntask during the release of the ML models or a just-in-time approach. In the just-in-time approach, the model would be obfuscated or encrypted before being downloaded to the end user’s desktop.\n\n3. Expected Solution.

        Description:
          "1682 Centralized Automated Solution for Price Estimation & Reasonability. 2.1 Background:\n2.1.1 Procurement is an essential component of any project. There are set rules and procedures to undertake various kinds of procurements. Each procurement methodology has several milestones, which too need careful planning and execution, to avoid time and cost over runs.\n2.1.2 As such, Government procurements are driven by the General Financial Rules (GFRs) and the Manuals for Procurement of Goods and of Services. Needless to say, all procurements are made keeping in mind transparency, fair competition amongst vendors as well as cost reasonability for the product services, as public money is involved.\n2.1.3 One of the important methodologies often employed in procurement processes is establishing the ‘price reasonability’ for a certain product/service. This methodology is generally applied at two stages, viz. while obtaining administrative approval for procuring the said product/service, and before opening the commercial bids of qualified vendors.\n2.1.4 The process of ascertaining the price reasonability of any product/service of interest is commonly known as Price Benchmarking.\n2.2 Detailed Description:\n2.2.1 There are various strategies to benchmark the cost. Some of them are as follows:\ni. Sometimes, the cost of the product or the rate at which service is to be hired are already defined by the Government. For example, labor rates.\nii. It may be possible that a similar product/service has been procured by the department in recent past. This can be taken as reference, known as the Last Purchase Price.\niii. When none of the above is known, the most prevalent technique to gather information about the approximate value of the product/service is Market Survey.\n2.2.2 Market Survey may be carried out physically by a team, as the name suggests, by actually visiting the market. However, this practice is only feasible for common goods/services such as stationery, common electrical appliances (AC, Fan, Lights etc), common services (sanitation, horticulture, maintenance etc). In case of sophisticated systems like Networking Solutions, Communication Systems, Sensors, Payloads and other Electronic Systems, this method does not work. In such cases, the market survey is carried out from information available in public domain.\n2.2.3 This presents a complex problem. Information about prices of items which are used in abundancy by various departments (e.g. routers, switches, Hard Disk Drives, Laptops, Workstations, Graphics Cards etc), are available in the public domain, generally speaking. On the other hand, Information about prices of not so common items (e.g. Microwave Devices, Waveguides, Transmission Lines, Antennae, HF/VHF equipment, Software Defined Radios, etc) may or may not be available, resulting in a hit- and-trial approach).\n\n2.2.4 Therefore a web-based application, which can assist various teams to tabulate the approximate price of products/services from various sources from information available in public domain, would be very useful. The contours of such an application is explained in subsequent paragraphs.\n2.3 Expected Solution:\n2.3.1 The solution will be web based. Users will first register themselves and thereafter use it, through their login credentials. The application interface will be simple without unnecessary graphics and multimedia for quick loading and fast responsiveness.\n2.3.2 The users can query the applications either by providing the exact make/model or the most relevant specifications in case of Products, or by providing general information in case of Services.\n2.3.3 Based on the inputs provided by the user, the application will use an appropriate method to crawl the web and gather information, which will then be presented to the user. The minimum input fields and the expected output fields are explained below, for various scenarios.\n(Drive link for further explanation of the expected solution : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oAwvekZ54TZpntQUnGdVF6gBvGk_NbIu/view?usp=sharing)",

In addition, one important requirement of Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) is that solution should be “offline and on-premise” and should be “updated with latest definition on regular basis”. Therefore, the reliable and effective solution can be developed by creating a pipeline combining multiple AV engines working parallelly offline. \nDescription: To develop a scanning pipeline in which the data residing in “Target Folder” will be scanned automatically by multiple antiviruses and accordingly the cleaned files will be in same folder and the infected files will be segregated and transferred in a specific folder i.e. “Infected Folders” with their analysis report.

          "1693 Developing a Robust Hydraulic Transient Analysis Model for Hydro Power and Pumped Storage Schemes. Background \nHydraulic transients, or water hammer phenomena, occur when there is a sudden change in water flow velocity, causing rapid pressure fluctuations within a hydraulic system. In hydropower and pumped storage schemes, these transients can lead to severe consequences such as pipe bursts, equipment damage, structural failures, and operational inefficiencies. Accurate prediction and management of these transients are essential to maintain the integrity, safety, and efficiency of these systems. Due to certain limitations in the existing models, there is a need for more precise, comprehensive and adaptable models that can simulate complex transient scenarios under varying operational conditions. \nDescription \nThere is a need for developing an advanced hydraulic transient analysis model that can accurately predict and manage the dynamic behavior of water within hydropower and pumped storage systems. This model should provide accurate and reliable results during tripping of units or sudden power failure. Under these conditions, the machine and water conductor system needs to be protected from damages. The time of closure of the guide vanes play an important role in avoiding adverse effects. The delay in closure of guide vanes causes speed rise on the machine and fast closure causes pressure rise issues. The goal is to enhance the resilience and performance of hydropower and pumped storage infrastructures by addressing the causes and consequences of hydraulic transients comprehensively. \nExpected Solution \nThere is need to develop a sophisticated model that can incorporate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the transient behavior of water within the water conductor system. This model should be able to handle complex scenarios such as sudden load changes, emergency shutdowns, start-up and other operational variations. Provide clear visual representations of pressure fluctuations, flow velocities and potential risk areas.

          "1694 Real-time Ganga river water quality forecasting using AI- enabled DSS, satellite data, IoT, and dynamic models. Background: Namami Gange is a flagship program of the government of India for the rejuvenation of Ganga and its tributaries. NMCG Authority order of Oct 2016 States the the pollution in River Ganga and its tributaries shall also be monitored by use of satellite and other remote sensing technologies.\nAs pupulations increase in the Ganga Basin, there are growing water demands, and hence higher levels of sewage flow into rivers of the Ganga Basin from both rural and urban areas. Excess untreated water entering the Ganga river systems transports high organic and pathogen loads. Their use generates high levels of pollution with significant organic loads, with very high Biochemical Oxygen Demand. This will inevitably lower Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers, thereby threatening fisheries and biodiversity (maacroinvertebrates). At the same time, the high sewage discharges affect the suitability of the river for bathing due to the higher levels ofpathogens in rivers. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of rainfall events, this is becoming a significant problem, threatening the water quality and ecology of Ganga river system. The societal impact of providing forecast data that is easily and openly accessible will change how we see and value our rivers and enable citizens to make better decisions based on better data for our health and the health of the rivers of Ganga Basin.\nDescription: An AI-enabled decision support system may be developed to Integrate data from multiple sources such as satellite data, IOT-based sensor-generated data, intrumental meteorological measurements, in-situ flow, water quality observations, and miltiple hydrological & hydrodynamic models to work together in real-time to generate historical patterns of behaviour and water quality forecasts for Ganga River.\nModel source code can be seamlessly incorporated into a cloud platform infrastructure. The models may receive daily inputs of current and forecasted precipitation and temperature data that drive real-time observations, may be stored in a time series database and automated workflows continually check observations against forecasts. The observed data may act as ground truth and help fine-tune the model's parameters and predictions. This dynamic calibration process may endure the system adapts to changing environmental conditions. The entire workflow may operate within a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, making it accessible to a wide range of users and organization. Users can access the daily water quality forecasts through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing them to set up early warning alert and conduct scenario modeling.\nThe overall strategy for the forecasting scheme synthesizes satellite data collected across the basin or watershed which is them linked to a model chain to generate flow and water quality data at key locations down a Ganga river system. The daily time series of flow and water quality data can then be displayed online or via a mobile app, to show recent and past changes in water quality. The system should forecast future flows and water quality, up to 3-5 days ahead. This then provides a warning system for operational managers who might want to switch supplies if a significant pollution pulse is moving down the river system. Also, rather like weather forecasts, a probability can be assigned to any forecast, so that users can evaluate predictions in terms of a familiar risk assessment. Regulatory agencies can make use of the system and App to help validate environment agency sampling at locations of interest that are not formal sample points for compliance, and for tracking pollution incidents that occur along river systems.\nExpected Solution: 1. To prepare an AI-enabled decision support system with focus on predictive and adaptive (query based) solutions. A mobile app is envised that utilizes satelliter data to procduce real-time forecasts of flow and water quality using hydrological & hydro dynamical models at multiple locations in a river network.\na. To create historical simulations of flow and water quality, as well as a three to 5 day ahead forecast at any location down the Ganga River, and to provide a tool that scientists, managers, or the general public might use.\nb.

These standard categories are\ndesigned to align with the Samagra Shiksha framework, which aims to ensure uniformity\nand consistency in the educational structures across the country. Schools falling outside\nthese categories, due to variations in grade configurations, are classified as having ""odd\nstructures.""\n\nHowever, 145,012 schools across the country fall into the ""odd"" school structure category\ndue to variations in grade configurations. These odd structures pose challenges for the\nuniform implementation of educational policies and schemes, such as Samagra Shiksha. This\nmisalignment is particularly significant in states like Goa, Mizoram, West Bengal, and Kerala,\nwhere the majority of schools do not conform to the standard categories.\n\nDescription:\nThe problem of odd school structures affects the equitable distribution of resources,\neffective policy implementation, and the overall quality of education. Schools with odd\nstructures are often excluded from the streamlined processes and benefits that come with\nstandardization. The national average of schools with odd structures is 14.28%, but in some\nstates, the percentage is much higher, complicating the delivery of educational initiatives.\nThe objective is to standardize these odd school structures by aligning them with the\ndefined categories under Samagra Shiksha, thereby improving the uniformity and\neffectiveness of educational policies across the country.\n\nInnovative Solutions:\n\nA. AI-Driven School Structure Analysis Tool: Develop software that uses AI to analyze\nschool data and automatically classify schools into standard categories or identify\nthem as odd structures. This tool can also suggest optimal restructuring options to\nalign schools with the standard categories.\nB. Standardization Support Platform: Create a platform that provides guidelines, best\npractices, and resources for schools to transition from odd to standard structures.\nThe platform could include modules on infrastructure planning, grade\nreconfiguration, and community engagement strategies.\nC.

Automatic change detection on such images have wider application for various use cases.\nDescription: Change detection between two SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite images are straight forward if they are co-registered as the difference or ratio of corresponding pixels of the two images itself will give the change map. But such change maps will invariably have many natural changes as well like water body extent, flood extent, snow cover and forest cover changes etc. Our interest is to detect only man made changes and avoid natural changes.\nThe solution can make use of Sentinel 1 SAR Open source satellite images and Google Earth Engine platform to access them. These images are co-registered by default. The GRD (Ground Range Detected) intensity image version of the Sentinel 1 SAR is to be used. Please note that images with same viewing geometry are better suited for change detection purposes. The solution should give the option for the user to vary the thresholds if any used for filtering change results. The change output should be in the form of polygons in a geographically referenced vector file. The solution should be scalable, means should be able to run on huge areas of interest and generate change alerts. The criteria for winning solution would be minimum false alarms with regard to man made changes.\nExpected Solution: A software based solution is expected that has a GUI to specify the area of interest for change detection and threshold controls to filter changes and output changes in the form of shapefiles/geojson with geographical references. It shall run above Google Earth Engine.",
