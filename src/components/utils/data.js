        Title: "Maximizing Section Throughput Using AI-Powered Precise Train Traffic Control",
        Category: "Software",
        Description: "Background\n\nIndian Railways manages train movements primarily through the experience of train traffic controllers. While effective, this manual approach faces limitations as network congestion and operational complexity grow. Trains of varying types and priorities must share limited track infrastructure across space and time, making optimal allocation a significant challenge. The problem is a large-scale combinatorial optimization task with numerous constraints such as safety, track resources, system of working, signalling system, platform availability, train schedules, and train priorities. As real-time decisions become increasingly complex, there is a growing need for intelligent, data-driven systems powered by optimization algorithms and AI to enhance efficiency, punctuality, and utilization of railway infrastructure.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nCurrently, experienced traffic controllers oversee operations and take real-time decisions\u2014whether a train should proceed, halt, or be rerouted\u2014based on operational conditions and institutional knowledge. With rising traffic volumes and higher expectations for punctuality, safety, and efficiency, manual decision-making alone is becoming insufficient.\n\nThe network is constrained by finite infrastructure\u2014limited track sections, junctions, crossings, and platform capacities\u2014shared by long-distance express, suburban local, freight, maintenance blocks, and unscheduled specials. Coordinating these movements across spatial (network layout) and temporal (scheduling) dimensions while maintaining safety and minimizing delays is formidable.\n\nWithin a section managed by a section controller, the core problem is to decide train precedence and crossings to maximize throughput and minimize overall train travel time, considering section characteristics (e.g., line capacity, gradients, signal placements) and varying train priorities. This represents a dynamic, large-scale combinatorial optimization problem with an exponentially large solution space, further complicated by real-time disruptions (breakdowns, weather, rolling stock delays). Human intuition alone is no longer sufficient; intelligent decision-support tools are required to improve precision, scalability, and responsiveness.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nAn intelligent decision-support system that assists section controllers in making optimized, real-time decisions for train precedence and crossings. The system should:\n\n\u2022 Leverage operations research and AI to model constraints, train priorities, and operational rules, producing conflict-free, feasible schedules dynamically.\n\u2022 Maximize section throughput and minimize overall train travel time, with the ability to re-optimize rapidly under disruptions (e.g., incidents, delays, weather).\n\u2022 Support what-if simulation and scenario analysis to evaluate alternative routings, holding strategies, and platform allocations.\n\u2022 Provide a user-friendly interface for controllers with clear recommendations, explanations, and override capabilities.\n\u2022 Integrate with existing railway control systems and data sources (signalling, TMS, timetables, rolling stock status) via secure APIs.\n\u2022 Include audit trails, performance dashboards, and KPIs (punctuality, average delay, throughput, utilization) for continuous improvement.",

        Category: "Software",
        Description: "Background: In dairy farming, evaluating the body structure of animals is vital to predict their longevity, productivity, and reproductive efficiency. Traditionally, Animal Type Classification (ATC)\u2014which involves scoring animals for physical traits\u2014is conducted by trained personnel through visual inspection and manual measurement of specific body parts. However, this manual method is prone to human error and subjectivity, even with trained professionals, resulting in inconsistent and potentially unreliable data.\n\nWith advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image processing technologies, there is an opportunity to automate this process. Automated scoring based on images can ensure standardization, minimize observer bias, and improve the reliability of data captured for scientific and breeding purposes.\n\nDescription: The Government of India is implementing the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) since December 2014, aiming to conserve and develop indigenous bovine breeds, genetically upgrade the bovine population, and enhance milk productivity. Under this mission, Progeny Testing (PT) and Pedigree Selection (PS) programs are being carried out in key dairy breeds across the country to produce high genetic merit bulls for breeding purposes.\n\nAnimal Type Classification (ATC) is a crucial step in identifying top-performing elite dams, which are potential mothers of future breeding bulls. Currently, ATC is performed manually by a trained Animal Typer who visually examines and measures physical traits, and then records the scores in the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA). Despite training, errors due to fatigue, bias, or measurement inaccuracies can adversely affect data quality and scientific analysis.\n\nThere is a need for an AI-driven solution that can automate this classification process by analyzing animal images, extracting body structure parameters, and assigning standardized scores with minimal human intervention. If integrated with BPA, such a solution would enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scientific validity of animal evaluation under PT and PS programs.\n\nExpected Solution: Students are expected to develop an AI-based Auto Recording of Animal Type Classification System that can:\n\nUse images of cattle and buffaloes to evaluate physical traits relevant to Animal Type Classification.\nExtract and quantify specific body structure parameters (e.g., body length, height at withers, chest width, rump angle, etc.) using AI and image processing techniques.\nGenerate objective and consistent classification scores.\nAuto-record and store the classification data in a structured format.\nProvide seamless integration with BPA to auto-save the classification records at the time of evaluation.\nBe user-friendly and operable by field personnel with minimal technical skills.",

        Category: "Hardware",
        Description: "Background\n\nThe majority of the farmers in India store the onion in naturally ventilated storage structures. In such structures, onions are exposed to extreme temperatures and relative humidity, which reduces the shelf life of onions and high storage loss. Improved onion storage technology will help in ensuring the availability of onions between seasons and obviate seasonal volatility in prices. The solutions could be in the form of improved, but cost-effective, materials and design of storage structures to manage temperature and relative humidity.\n\nDescription\n\nOnion is a semi-perishable vegetable and is harvested during the rabi season, accounting for 65% of onion production, and hits the markets from April to May. The same crop must continue to meet the consumer demand till the month of October-November every year, before the kharif crop is harvested and brought to the market. It is therefore vital to store onions successfully in order to meet the regular supply. It is observed that nearly 30-40% of the crop is lost during storage due to various reasons in form of physiological weight loss, rotting, sprouting etc. In unexpected situations such as natural calamities, the losses even go beyond 50% creating heavy stress both on the demand and supply sides. The losses that occurred during storage are in terms of qualitative as well as in quantitative ways. Hence, it is imperative to take some crucial steps pertaining to onion storage with minimum losses to ensure an adequate supply to the market, thereby reducing the price fluctuations.\n\nVarious abiotic factors like temperature, relative humidity affect the health of onions; hence, their balance is essential to store the crop with minimum losses. Recent technological advancements (such as Design, Solar/Plasma/Irradiation energy, Nanotechnology, IoT including AI/ML) also offer an opportunity to provide infrastructure for onion storage and supply chain, besides value addition, even in rural India. Design innovations are pervading various sectors, including efficient onion storage at the farm level, rural as well as urban markets. Different process and product development advances will fetch better returns to farmers and competitive prices for consumers. More importantly, it will help in addressing the present as well as the impending challenges.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nExtension of shelf life with minimum loss.",

Incorrect entries compromise the value of collected data and, in turn, impact the effectiveness of genetic improvement, nutrition planning, disease control, and overall program outcomes.\n\nTo address this, an AI-driven solution that can identify the breed of an animal using its image can prove extremely valuable. By using image recognition and machine learning techniques, the software can standardize breed identification and minimize manual errors. If successfully developed and validated, such a system can be integrated with the BPA to act as a decision-support tool for FLWs during registration.\n\nExpected Solution\n\n• Uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image analysis to recognize and classify the breed of cattle and buffaloes based on images.\n• Can handle diverse environmental backgrounds, lighting conditions, and varying animal poses.\n• Maintains a breed database (for the most common Indian cattle and buffalo breeds and their crosses).\n• Provides breed suggestions or confirmations at the time of registration in BPA.\n• Can be seamlessly integrated with the BPA platform to support real-time validation or correction of breed entries.\n• Includes a user-friendly interface for FLWs with minimal technical training requirements.",

        Category: "Software",
        Description: "Urban traffic congestion in Indian cities is worsened by the limitations of current urban planning software, which often assumes ideal, well-maintained road conditions typical of developed countries. Such software fails to account for the unpredictable and nuanced realities of Indian roads\u2014such as potholes, temporary barricades, partial lane closures, construction activities, and erratic driver behaviors. Manually modeling these complex and dynamic road features into digital twins for realistic traffic simulations is both tedious and time-consuming, often requiring significant engineering effort before any meaningful simulation can be conducted. To address this challenge, MathWorks is seeking innovative solutions to accelerate the creation of highly detailed digital twins of existing Indian road junctions and networks. The aim is to design toolsets, templates, asset libraries, or workflows\u2014leveraging MATLAB, Simulink, Automated Driving Toolbox, RoadRunner, and potentially generative AI\u2014that significantly streamline the process. The solution should enable users to easily incorporate typical Indian road features and simulate hyper-local vehicular behaviors in their modeling, thereby empowering traffic management agencies to run realistic simulations for crisis handling, congestion management, and infrastructure planning. Proposals should focus on enhancing the modeling process rather than traffic optimization and must integrate seamlessly with MATLAB-based simulation workflows.

Students must rely on self-study material or travel to cities for coaching,deepening the urban-rural learning divide. Description: The challenge is less about willingness than about infrastructure. Typical village campuses juggle low and unstable data speeds, making conventional video-conferencing unreliable. Previous interventions failed when platforms assumed high-bandwidth links or required complicated equipment. To succeed, a new approach must embrace low-bandwidth realities, prioritise audio quality, compress visual content, and ensure that learning can continue even during connectivity lapses. It should encourage synchronous interaction yet also provide recordings that remain small enough for easy download on limited data plans. Faculty in cities need a simple way to deliver lectures from any quiet corner, while rural students require a user experience that functions on entry-level smartphones. Interactive elements quizzes, polls, discussion boards-must remain functional at low speeds.Crucially, the entire solution should minimise the leaming curve for educators and be financially sustainable for resource-constrained institutes. By offering a design that blends live engagement with asynchronous access, the college can bring expert instruction to every campus without waiting for large capital investments.This is precisely the sort of context-aware challenge that Smart India Hackathon teams can address through innovative but lightweight software solutions.

Around 24% was dumped in landfills and 22% remained unaccounted due to leakages in the waste management chain. This unaccounted waste is often burned or disposed of in open areas, drains, or water bodies, posing severe environmental and public health risks. (CEEW, 2025) This calls for strict solutions to enable all the waste generators to contribute to Waste Management.\n\nDescription\n\nOverview: According to the CPCB\u2019s Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Annual Report for 2021-22, India generates approximately 1,70,339 tonnes of waste per day (TPD). Of this, around 1,56,449 TPD is collected. Out of the collected waste, 91,511 TPD is treated, while 41,455 TPD is disposed of in landfills. This leaves a significant gap of 37,373 TPD in effective waste management.\nWaste treatment: The total waste processed/treated across the country is 91,511 TPD. When compared to the total waste generated, which is 1,70,339 TPD, it is found that an average of 54% of the waste is treated/processed across the country.\nSolid Waste Processing Facilities: A total of 249 Waste-to-Energy plants, 819 Biomass Power plants and 50.8 lakhs small Biogas plants have been set up in the country to generate Power/Biogas/BioCNG.\n\nExpected Solutions\n\nThe proposals aim to develop a strict system to ensure that every citizen is trained on waste management, waste workers get strict training and required safety gear, waste management facilities are present in every ULB/GP, and a dedicated decentralised monitoring system is in place. The solutions are as follows:\n1.

Formation of Area Committee for Monitoring \u2013 to be called as \u201cGreen Champions\u201d: Decentralised approach for Monitoring has to be done at every step of Waste Management for bulk waste generators, residential areas, commercial & Public semi-public building, Industrial buildings, etc.\n  i. Training of all Waste Generators\n  ii. Waste Generation: Source segregation happening or not, no wet waste to be collected\n  iii. Waste Collection happening on ground level\n  iv. Waste transportation\n  v. Waste treatment\n  vi. Waste Disposal\n4. Incentive based approach: Incentive to Bulk waste generators and other buildings for source segregation.\n5. Waste Movements in ULBs: Taking example from Karnataka\u2019s Yadgir city, \u201cIf you see waste, send photo\u201d similar movement to be made mandatory for every ULB regardless of its size and population, to ensure community participation.\n6.

        Category: "Software",
        Description: "Since its first commercial run in 2017, KMRL has grown into a complex, multidisciplinary enterprise that stretches far beyond train operations. Every business day the Problem Creater's Organization generates and receives thousands of pages of material: engineering drawings, maintenance job cards, incident reports, vendor invoices, purchase-order correspondence, regulatory directives, environmental-impact studies, safety circulars, HR policies, legal opinions, and board-meeting minutes. These arrive through e-mail, Maximo exports, SharePoint repositories, WhatsApp PDFs, hard-copy scans, and ad-hoc cloud links\u2014often in both English and Malayalam, sometimes in bilingual hybrids, frequently with embedded tables, photos, or signatures. The sheer diversity and volume have created a silent productivity tax: \u25cf Information latency: Front-line managers spend hours skimming lengthy documents for the few actionable lines that affect their shift, delaying decisions on train availability, contractor payments, or staffing reallocations. \u25cf Siloed awareness: Procurement may negotiate a spare-parts contract without realizing that Engineering has already flagged an upcoming design change HR may schedule refresher training unaware of a new safety bulletin released the previous evening. \u25cf Compliance exposure: Regulatory updates from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety and the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs are buried in inboxes, risking missed deadlines or audit non-conformities. \u25cf Knowledge attrition: Institutional memory remains locked in static files when key personnel transfer or retire, hard-won insights vanish with them. \u25cf Duplicated effort: Different teams independently create summaries or slide decks of the same source documents, multiplying manual work and version-control headaches. As KMRL prepares to expand its corridor, add two new depots, and integrate emerging technologies such as Unified Namespace (UNS) data streams and IoT condition monitoring, the documentary burden will only intensify. Without an Problem Creater's Organization-wide mechanism to condense, contextualize, and route critical information, the metro risks slower decision cycles, avoidable operating costs, diminished service reliability, and heightened safety and legal vulnerabilities. The challenge, therefore, is to equip every stakeholder\u2014from station controllers and rolling-stock engineers to finance officers and executive directors\u2014with rapid, trustworthy snapshots of the documents that matter to them, while preserving traceability to the original source. Solving this problem will unlock faster cross-department coordination, strengthen regulatory compliance, safeguard institutional knowledge, and ultimately support KMRL\u2019s mission of delivering safe, efficient, and passenger-centric urban transit to Kochi.",

        Description: "Kochi Metro must decide every night which of its 25 four-car trainsets will enter revenue service at dawn, which remain on standby, and which are held back in the Inspection Bay Line (IBL) for maintenance. The decision hinges on six inter-dependent variables: 1. Fitness Certificates \u2013 validity windows issued by Rolling-Stock, Signalling and Telecom departments. 2. Job-Card Status \u2013 open vs. closed work orders exported from IBM Maximo. 3. Branding Priorities \u2013 contractual commitments that dictate exterior wrap exposure hours. 4. Mileage Balancing \u2013 kilometre allocation to equalise bogie, brake-pad and HVAC wear. 5. Cleaning & Detailing Slots \u2013 available manpower and bay occupancy for interior deep-cleaning. 6. Stabling Geometry \u2013 physical bay positions that minimise nightly shunting and morning turn-out time. At present these data points reside in siloed spreadsheets, manual logbooks, and daily WhatsApp updates. Supervisors reconcile them in a time-compressed window (21:00\u201323:00 IST) using ad-hoc filters and experience-based heuristics. The process is opaque, non-repeatable, and highly error-prone: \u25cf Missing a single telecom clearance can force an unscheduled rake withdrawal, eroding the 99.5 % punctuality KPI. \u25cf Uneven mileage assignment accelerates component fatigue, inflating maintenance cost. \u25cf Inadequate visibility into branding priorities risks breaching advertiser SLAs, exposing KMRL to revenue penalties. \u25cf Excessive night-time shunting to rearrange rakes increases energy consumption and track-occupancy safety risk. With fleet size slated to grow to 40 trainsets and two depots by 2027, the existing manual workflow cannot scale linearly\u2014neither in staffing nor in cognitive load. Therefore, KMRL requires an integrated, algorithm-driven decision-support platform that can: \u25cf Ingest heterogeneous inputs (Maximo exports, IoT fitness sensors, UNS streams, manual overrides) in near-real-time. \u25cf Enforce rule-based constraints and multi-objective optimisation (service readiness, reliability, cost, branding exposure). \u25cf Generate a ranked induction list with explainable reasoning, conflict alerts, and \u201cwhat-if\u201d simulation. \u25cf Learn from historical outcomes via machine-learning feedback loops to improve forecast accuracy over time. Such a system will transform induction planning from a manual reconciliation exercise into a reproducible, auditable, data-driven process\u2014delivering higher fleet availability, lower lifecycle cost, and an enhanced passenger experience while freeing operations staff to focus on strategic exceptions rather than routine data wrangling.",

These programs feature flexible, creditbased, multidisciplinary structures allowing students to choose Major, Minor, Skill-Based, Ability Enhancement, and Value-Added courses. Manual timetable creation under this new framework has become extremely complex, involving numerous subject combinations, varying credit hours, student preferences, and faculty workload distribution.

        Title: "Develop a blockchain-based system for botanical traceability of Ayurvedic herbs including geo-tagging from the point of collection (farmers/wild collectors) to the final Ayurvedic formulation label",
        Category: "Software",
        Description: "Background\n\nThe Ayurvedic herbal supply chain in India is characterised by fragmented networks of smallholder farmers, wild collectors and multiple intermediaries, leading to challenges in ensuring consistent quality, authenticity and sustainable sourcing of medicinal plants. Variations in harvesting practices, environmental conditions and manual record-keeping introduce risks of mislabeling, adulteration and over-harvesting of vulnerable species, undermining consumer trust and compliance with regulatory standards. Geographic provenance is often undocumented or opaque, making it difficult for manufacturers and regulators to verify that herbs originate from approved regions or follow sustainable collection guidelines.\n\nA blockchain-based traceability system, augmented with geo-tagging technology, can address these gaps by creating an immutable, decentralised ledger that records every step of the herb's journey\u2014from on-site GPS-tagged collection events through processing, testing and formulation. Smart contracts on a permissioned network (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) can enforce sustainability criteria and automate quality validations, while IoT-enabled devices capture real-time location and environmental data at remote collection points, even via SMS-over-blockchain gateways where connectivity is sparse. By integrating FHIR-style metadata bundles (e.g., \"CollectionEvent,\" \"QualityTest,\" \"ProcessingStep\") and QR-code scanning at aggregation nodes, stakeholders gain end-to-end visibility, enabling rapid verification of provenance, streamlined certification for export and robust audit trails to support both biodiversity conservation and supply-chain efficiency. When herbs are formulated into finished products, unique, serialised QR codes generated by the blockchain platform could be affixed to each package. End customers scan these codes with a mobile app or web portal\u2014powered by the same blockchain ledger\u2014to retrieve a FHIR-style provenance bundle detailing each upstream event: farm of origin, harvest conditions, intermediary custody, laboratory certificates and batch formulation parameters. This consumer-facing transparency not only verifies authenticity and builds trust, but also supports ethical marketing, enables rapid recall management and fosters incentives for sustainable collection practices by linking premium pricing to verified harvest data. Over time, analytics on consumer scans can feed back into demand forecasting, closing the loop between consumer assurance and supply-chain optimisation.\n\nDescription\n\nA permissioned blockchain network will immutably record every stage of an Ayurvedic herb's journey\u2014from geo-tagged harvest events by farmers or wild collectors, through multi-stage processing and laboratory testing, to the finished product on retail shelves. At the point of collection, GPS-enabled mobile or IoT devices capture precise location, timestamp, collector identity, species identification and initial quality metrics as a \"Collection Event.\" Subsequent \"Processing Step\" and \"Quality Test\" events\u2014each embedding standardised metadata bundles\u2014are added by processing facilities and testing laboratories. Smart contracts enforce National Medicinal Plants Board sustainability guidelines and Good Agricultural and Collection Practices by automatically validating geo-fencing rules, seasonal restrictions and quality thresholds before committing each transaction to the ledger.\n\nWhen formulation is complete, unique QR codes generated on-chain are affixed to product packaging. End customers scan these codes via a lightweight web or mobile portal (no specialised app required) to retrieve the full provenance record: farm coordinates and harvest conditions; chain-of-custody handoffs; lab certificates for moisture, pesticide and DNA-barcode tests; and sustainability and fair-trade compliance proofs. This consumer-facing transparency assures authenticity and safety, enables rapid recall notifications for affected batches and tells the story of each product\u2014complete with interactive maps and farmer or community profiles. By combining tamper-proof audit trails, geo-tagged traceability and automated compliance enforcement, the system delivers a replicable model for ethical, sustainable and trust-driven Ayurvedic herb sourcing.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nParticipants will deliver a proof-of-concept blockchain-based botanical traceability system addressing end-to-end provenance of Ayurvedic herbs. The solution should include the following core components and capabilities:\n\n1. Permissioned Blockchain Network\n\u2022 A lightweight, permissioned ledger (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric or Corda) that records every supply-chain transaction.\n\u2022 Network nodes representing farmers' cooperatives, wild-collector groups, testing laboratories, processing facilities and manufacturers.\n\u2022 Smart contracts enforcing:\n- Geo-fencing rules based on collectors' GPS coordinates and approved harvesting zones.\n- Seasonal-harvest restrictions and species-specific conservation limits per National Medicinal Plants Board guidelines.\n- Quality-gate validations (e.g., moisture thresholds, pesticide limits, DNA barcoding checks).\n\n2. Geo-Tagged Data Capture\n\u2022 IoT/GPS-enabled mobile DApp (or SMS-over-blockchain gateway) for collectors to record \"CollectionEvent\" metadata: latitude/longitude, timestamp, collector ID, species and initial quality metrics.\n\u2022 Sensor integrations or manual interfaces for \"QualityTest\" events (lab results) and \"ProcessingStep\" events (drying, grinding, storage conditions).\n\n3. Smart Labeling & Consumer Portal\n\u2022 On-chain generation of unique QR codes for each finished product batch.\n\u2022 A lightweight web/mobile portal (no specialised install required) allowing end customers to scan QR codes and retrieve a complete FHIR-style provenance bundle:\n- Collection location map and harvest details\n- Chain-of-custody handoffs through each supply-chain node\n- Laboratory certificates for moisture, pesticide analysis, DNA authentication\n- Sustainability compliance proofs and fair-trade verifications\n- Interactive farmer/community profiles and conservation credentials\n\n4. Integration & Interoperability\n\u2022 RESTful APIs for supply-chain managers to query real-time dashboards of harvest volumes, batch statuses, QA results and sustainability metrics.\n\u2022 Plugins or connectors to existing ERP/quality-management systems for seamless data exchange.\n\u2022 Use of FHIR-style resource models (CollectionEvent, QualityTest, ProcessingStep, Provenance) for standardized metadata exchange.\n\n5. User Interfaces & Reporting\n\u2022 A mobile DApp interface optimized for low-bandwidth rural environments, with offline data capture and SMS synchronization.\n\u2022 A web dashboard for stakeholders to monitor network health, query provenance records and generate compliance reports aligned with AYUSH Ministry export and sustainability requirements.\n\u2022 Automated reporting modules that compile environmental-impact metrics and conservation compliance data for certification bodies.\n\n6. Demonstration & Evaluation\n\u2022 A live pilot using one botanical species (e.g., Ashwagandha) across a small farming cooperative and a collaborating processor.\n\u2022 End-to-end demonstration: geo-tagging harvest, adding lab results, processing events, QR code scanning by simulated consumers and recall simulation.\n\u2022 Metrics collection on data-capture latency, transaction throughput, offline sync reliability and consumer-scan engagement.\n\nBy delivering these elements, participants will showcase a replicable, transparent and sustainable model for botanical traceability that bridges traditional Ayurvedic sourcing with modern blockchain technology and consumer empowerment.",

        Title: "Development of Sensor for Detection Of Microplastics",
        Category: "Hardware",
        Description: "Background\n\nMicroplastics \u2014 plastic particles less than 5 mm in size \u2014 have emerged as a global environmental threat, contaminating oceans, freshwater systems, and even drinking water. These particles originate from the degradation of larger plastics or from microbeads in consumer products. Their persistence and bioaccumulative nature pose serious risks to aquatic life, ecosystems, and potentially human health. Current methods for detecting microplastics \u2014 such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy \u2014 are often accurate but time-consuming, expensive, and laboratory-dependent, limiting their application for real-time, field-based monitoring.\n\nDescription\n\nThe project aims to develop a low-cost, efficient, and portable sensor capable of detecting microplastics in various water sources. The focus may be on using optical detection techniques \u2014 such as light scattering, fluorescence, or absorbance \u2014 combined with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition. The sensor may be designed to identify microplastic particles based on their optical signatures, size distribution, and possibly polymer type. Water samples shall pass through a detection chamber, where embedded sensors capture spectral or visual data. This information would be processed in real time, either on-device or via a connected application. The system should be tested using standard microplastic samples (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene) and validated against existing lab-based techniques.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nThe expected outcome is a compact, field-deployable sensor system that can detect and quantify microplastics in water samples within minutes. It should offer reasonable sensitivity (down to 10\u2013100 \u03bcm), operate on battery or solar power, and require minimal sample preparation. Additionally, the solution may include a companion software interface for data logging, visualization, and analysis. This innovation should have strong potential for adoption in microplastic monitoring, supporting researchers, environmental agencies, and water quality managers in making faster, data-driven decisions for pollution control and mitigation.",

        Category: "Hardware",
        Description: "Background\n\nGrain size is a fundamental property used to classify beach types and plays a critical role in influencing coastal morphodynamic processes. However, measuring grain size is particularly challenging, as it requires scientists to visit each site to collect sediment samples. These samples must then undergo time-consuming physical processing in the laboratory to determine their characteristics. Moreover, because beach sediments are dynamic and constantly changing due to wave action, tides, and weather events, this process must be repeated regularly to maintain accurate and up-to-date data.\n\nDescription\n\nThe above problem statement envisages that a low-cost camera-based automated mapping system be developed to estimate the sediment grain size distribution of the sandy beach area (i.e., berm, intertidal, and dune) and classify the beach Category of the measurement region. A low-cost camera-based mapping system, along with automated prediction algorithms, is used to estimate the sediment grain size distribution of a particular area of interest to be developed. Also, this system should incorporate a GNSS/GPS receiver to map the geographic positions of the measurement location.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nA low-cost camera-based mapping system with a GNSS/GPS receiver should be developed with an automated image processing algorithm for beach sand grain size estimation/classification. Validation should be performed at least on one sample based on data collected in the area of interest.",

The Argo program, which deploys autonomous profiling floats across the world\u2019s oceans, generates an extensive dataset in NetCDF format containing temperature, salinity, and other essential ocean variables. Accessing, querying, and visualizing this data requires domain knowledge, technical skills, and familiarity with complex formats and tools.

        Title: "Identifying Taxonomy and Assessing Biodiversity from eDNA Datasets",
        Category: "Software",
        Description: "Background\n\nThe deep ocean, encompassing vast and remote ecosystems like abyssal plains, hydrothermal vents, and seamounts, harbors a significant portion of global biodiversity, much of which remains undiscovered due to its inaccessibility. Understanding deep-sea biodiversity is critical for elucidating ecological interactions (e.g., food webs, nutrient cycling), informing conservation strategies for vulnerable marine habitats, and identifying novel eukaryotic species with potential biotechnological or ecological significance.\n\nEnvironmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive tool for studying these ecosystems by capturing genetic traces of organisms from environmental samples, such as seawater or sediment, without the need for physical collection or disturbance of fragile habitats. By targeting marker genes like 18S rRNA or COI, eDNA enables the detection of diverse eukaryotic taxa, including protists, cnidarians, and rare metazoans, offering insights into species richness and community structure.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE) will undertake routine voyages to the deep sea and collect sediment and water samples from hotspot regions for biodiversity assessment and ecosystem monitoring. The water and sediment samples will be used to extract eDNA and will be subject to high-throughput sequencing.\n\nHowever, assigning raw eDNA sequencing reads to eukaryotic taxa or inferring their ecological roles presents significant challenges, primarily due to the poor representation of deep-sea organisms in reference databases like SILVA, PR2, or NCBI. These databases, built primarily from well-studied terrestrial or shallow-water species, lack comprehensive sequences for deep-sea eukaryotes, leading to misclassifications, unassigned reads, or underestimation of biodiversity.\n\nTraditional bioinformatic pipelines for eDNA analysis, such as those implemented in QIIME2, DADA2, or mothur, rely heavily on sequence alignment or mapping to these databases, which is inadequate for novel or divergent deep-sea taxa. This dependency limits the discovery of new species and hinders accurate biodiversity assessments, critical for conservation in rapidly changing deep-sea environments. The computational time required for processing eDNA data exacerbates these challenges, particularly given the limitations of database-dependent methods and the complexity of eDNA datasets.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nTo address the challenges of poor database representation and computational time in deep-sea eDNA analysis, we propose an AI-driven pipeline that uses deep learning and unsupervised learning to identify eukaryotic taxa and assess biodiversity directly from raw eDNA reads. The solution should be able to classify the sequences, annotate and estimate abundance. This solution minimizes reliance on reference databases, reduces computational time through optimized workflows, and enables the discovery of novel taxa and ecological insights in deep-sea ecosystems.",

        Title: "Automated Specimen Preparation System for testing of Cable samples as per IS 10810 and IS 7098",
        Category: "Hardware",
        Description: "Background\n\nAccurate and consistent preparation of cable specimens is vital for reliable testing according to Indian Standards like IS 10810 (Parts 2, 7, 33) and IS 7098 (Parts 1 & 2). These tests, including conductor resistance, insulation/sheath thickness, and flame retardance, are crucial for ensuring cable safety and quality.\n\nExisting Problem\n\nCurrently, cable sample preparation involves significant manual intervention. The cable sample is manually cut by the operator and then straightened manually. Subsequently, these straightened PVC/XLPE/HDPE cable samples are cut into slices using electrically/pneumatically operated machines. Further, the samples are shaped as dumbbells by a dumbbell cutting machine. These manual and semi-automated steps are time-consuming, prone to human error, and introduce inconsistencies that compromise the accuracy and repeatability of critical test results.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nThis project develops an automated machine designed to precisely cut insulation and outer sheaths from cables, preparing specimens that strictly adhere to the aforementioned IS standards. Key features include an Automated Cable Feeding and Clamping System utilizing motor-driven rollers and adjustable clamps for secure, straightened cable handling. The Cutting and Stripping Module employs precision blades with programmable depths for clean, circumferential cuts and linear stripping, fulfilling specific length requirements for various tests. An integrated diameter sensor will auto-adjust settings. A Control System (PLC/HMI) manages operations, allows test method selection, monitors status, and provides closed-loop feedback. Automated specimen ejection and waste management further streamline workflow. Robust safety features like enclosed areas and interlocks will protect operators.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nThe automated machine will eliminate human error, guaranteeing consistent and repeatable specimen quality while significantly reducing preparation time and costs. By ensuring strict adherence to IS standards, the solution will yield more reliable test results and simplify product certification. This advancement will markedly improve accuracy, efficiency, and safety in cable testing, supporting high-quality control in the cable manufacturing industry.",

        Title: "To explore new/alternative assaying methods to the fire assay method for testing of gold jewellery and artefacts through non-destructive testing",
        Category: "Hardware",
        Description: "Background:\nHallmarking is the accurate determination and official recording of the proportionate content of precious metal in the jewellery/artefacts or bullion/coins. The hallmarking of gold jewellery was started in year 2000 and has been made mandatory since 23 June 2021 and presently covers 361 districts.\n\nThe Indian Standard, IS 1417 2016 \"Gold and gold alloys, jewellery/artefacts-fineness and marking specification\" covers hallmarking of six grades of gold jewellery/gold artefacts viz. 14K, 18K, 20K, 22K, 23K and 24K carats. The Indian Standard, IS 1418: 2009 \"Determination of gold in gold bullion, gold alloys and gold jewellery/artefacts - Cupellation (Fire Assay) method\" prescribes the fire assay test method for determining the fineness of gold in gold bullion, alloys, and jewellery/artefacts.\n\nThe fire assay testing method, though globally accepted and accurate, involves a destructive testing process wherein a sample of 250-500 mg is taken from the item by scrapping, drilling, or cutting. The method may lead to the damage of the article, rendering it unsellable, especially when dealing with a few or single article. However, the gold loss incurred during testing is almost negligible. Additionally, the process emits hazardous substances like lead oxides and nitrous fumes.\n\nFurther, BIS has also formulated an Indian Standard on method of test using ED-XRF (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence), i.e., IS 18458: 2023 \"Jewellery and precious metals ED-XRF test - Method of test\". This Indian Standard prescribes a non-destructive testing method to verify the fineness of the gold jewellery. However, the use of ED-XRF as a non-destructive method to determine the fineness is only applicable to homogenous gold jewellery. In addition, IS 18458: 2023 also has a provision for determination of fineness of jewellery by destructive testing, which is more suited for non-homogeneous jewellery.\n\nThere is another Indian Standard developed by BIS, IS 16901: 2022 \"Jewellery and precious metals determination of high purity gold, platinum and palladium - difference method using ICP-OES\". This method uses ICP-OES and is applicable only for high purity gold (999 ppt and above). ICP-OES is also a destructive testing method.\n\nIndia's gold jewellery industry is highly diverse, encompassing various types such as casted jewellery, handmade pieces with soldered joints, hollow and filled jewellery, gold-plated items, and studded ornaments using various jewellery manufacturing techniques. While casted jewellery is relatively homogeneous, the majority-particularly handmade and hollow varieties-are structurally complex and heterogeneous. This variability presents significant challenges in testing and hallmarking.\n\nIn the existing fire assay testing method, heterogeneity is addressed by melting the sample before testing. This eliminates impurities and ensures homogeneity. Moreover, fire assay being a difference method (based on initial and final weight of gold sample), the impact of heterogeneity is nullified. However, owing to its destructive nature, there is strong demand for an alternative non-destructive testing method.\n\nExpected Solution:\na. Develop and implement a non-destructive assaying method that matches the accuracy of fire assay without damaging the jewellery, while being capable of handling heterogeneous compositions (solders, fillers, non-metallic substances).\nb. Eliminate emissions of harmful substances (lead oxide, nitrous fumes).\nc. Achieve repeatability close to that of fire assay, ideally within \u00b10.5 ppt (as per IS 1418).\nd. Method selected will be validated for regulatory and commercial applications.\n\nDeliverables:\na. Detailed non-destructive innovative testing method with technical explanation\nb. References/bibliography related to the technical paper\nc. Scientific principles underlying the approach\nd. Feasibility studies and expected challenges\ne. Methodology for validation including accuracy assessment\nf. Explanatory note on potential for regulatory and commercial application",

        Description: "Background\n\nIndia is facing a growing e-waste crisis, generating over 1.75 million tonnes annually. A key reason why millions of old laptops and smartphones remain unused or improperly discarded is fear of data breaches. Most users hesitate to recycle their devices due to concerns about sensitive personal or Problem Creater's Organizational data being recovered. Existing data sanitization tools are either too complex, expensive, or lack verifiable proof of erasure. This gap has led to over \u20b950,000 crore worth of IT assets being hoarded in homes and offices, hindering circular economy efforts. A user-friendly, tamper-proof, and auditable data wiping solution is urgently needed to promote safe disposal and reuse of electronic devices.\n\nProblem Statement\n\nDesign and prototype a secure, cross-platform data wiping application that works on Windows, Linux, and Android devices. The tool must:\n- Securely erase all user data, including hidden storage areas like HPA/DCO and SSD sectors.\n- Generate a digitally signed, tamper-proof wipe certificate (in PDF and JSON formats).\n- Feature an intuitive one-click interface suitable for general public use.\n- Offer offline usability (e.g., bootable ISO/USB).\n- Enable third-party verification of wipe status.\n- Be scalable, standards-compliant (aligned with NIST SP 800-88), and support trust and transparency in IT asset disposal and recycling workflows.\n\nImpact\n\nThis solution will build user confidence in device recycling, reduce hoarding of IT assets, promote safe e-waste management, and advance India\u2019s circular economy initiatives.",

        Description: "About CMLRE\n\nCMLRE, Kochi, an attached office under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, plays a key role in organising and promoting ocean development activities in India, with a focus on mapping, assessing, and managing marine living resources in the Indian EEZ. The Marine Living Resources Programme supports ecosystem-based research and monitoring, aimed at sustainable utilisation of these resources through scientific surveys, environmental studies, and data-driven ecosystem modelling.\n\nBackground\n\nIndia, with its vast coastline and rich marine biodiversity, relies heavily on the health of its ocean ecosystems for food security, climate regulation, and economic development. The Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE), under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, plays a pivotal role in collecting, managing, and analysing a broad spectrum of marine data to support sustainable ocean resource management.\n\nDetailed description\n\nCMLRE's datasets are diverse, complex, and multidisciplinary, including physical, chemical, and biological oceanography; fish abundance, species diversity, life history traits, and ecomorphology; fish taxonomy and otolith morphology; molecular biology data, including environmental DNA (eDNA) for species detection and biodiversity assessments. These datasets exist across various formats (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured), and are stored in siloed systems, making cross-domain integration, real-time visualization, and advanced analytics nearly impossible. This creates a major bottleneck for marine scientists, conservationists, and policymakers who need to make data-driven decisions for ecosystem conservation and fisheries management.\n\nCMLRE seeks an AI-enabled, intelligent digital platform that can integrate heterogeneous and high-volume datasets from oceanography, taxonomy, morphology, and molecular biology into a single unified system. The platform should support automated data ingestion, standardisation, and metadata tagging using internationally accepted formats, enable cross-disciplinary correlation analysis to study how ocean parameters influence biodiversity, fish distribution, and ecosystem health, and incorporate interactive modules for otolith shape and morphometrics visualisation, taxonomic classification and species identification, and molecular and eDNA data storage/retrieval and species matching.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThis platform will serve as a national marine data backbone, empowering India's scientific community with a next-generation tool for holistic marine ecosystem assessment. It will improve the efficiency of marine biodiversity research, enhance real-time decision-making, and support blue economy initiatives by enabling sustainable fisheries and conservation planning through integrated data insights.\n\nExpected Deliverables\n\n\u2022 A robust, cloud-ready web platform prototype.\n\u2022 Scalable backend architecture with modular data ingestion pipelines.\n\u2022 Visualisation tools for oceanographic and biodiversity trends.\n\u2022 Integrated modules for managing taxonomy, otolith morphology, and eDNA data.\n\u2022 Well-documented APIs and user manuals for future adoption and scaling.",

        Category: "Hardware",
        Description: "Background\n\nKerala has a large penetration of Roof Top Solar PV systems amounting to nearly 1500 MW. These systems are connected to low voltage distribution feeders either in single-phase or three-phase mode. A majority of the systems are below 5 kW and hence get connected in single-phase, which causes severe unbalanced loading in feeders and results in an uneven voltage profile. This unbalanced loading also limits the quantum of PV that can be integrated into the network.\n\nAny load balancing work carried out during daytime under PV injection gets negated during the evening peak hours when solar power is unavailable. This situation calls for a solution that can dynamically reconfigure the network based on renewable energy (RE) injection and local demand scenarios.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nA cost-effective controller incorporating IoT and edge intelligence can be developed at the local node level for auto-balancing of the load across various phases in a feeder under the above conditions.",

        Category: "Hardware",
        Description: "Background\n\nThe current dewatering system at our copper mining site relies heavily on electrically operated pumps, often supplemented by diesel generators during power outages. This traditional setup not only leads to high operational expenses due to electricity and fuel consumption, but also contributes to increased carbon emissions, operational complexity, and maintenance challenges.\n\nIn light of rising energy costs and the need for reliable and sustainable mine dewatering solutions, there is a pressing need to explore alternative approaches. Solar-powered dewatering systems offer a viable solution, leveraging renewable energy to reduce costs, ensure consistent pump operation, and support broader environmental and sustainability goals. Implementing such systems under an OPEX (Operational Expenditure) model aligns with the strategy to minimize capital expenditure while transitioning to cleaner and more efficient mining practices.\n\nProblem\n\nThis outlines the implementation of solar-powered dewatering pumps at the copper mining site under an OPEX model. The system will integrate solar photovoltaic (PV) modules with energy-efficient submersible or surface pumps, designed to meet site-specific dewatering requirements.\n\nA third-party vendor will be engaged to install, operate, and maintain the system through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) or operational lease, eliminating the need for upfront capital investment by HCL. The system can be configured as stand-alone solar or hybrid (solar with grid/diesel backup) to ensure uninterrupted pumping. The proposed solution aims to reduce operational energy costs, enhance dewatering reliability, and support environmental commitments by minimizing diesel use and lowering carbon emissions.\n\nTechnical specifications are attached.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nDeployment of solar-powered, energy-efficient dewatering pumps under an OPEX model to ensure reliable, low-cost, and eco-friendly mine dewatering. The system will reduce diesel and electricity usage, include hybrid backup, and feature vendor-managed operation and maintenance.",

        Description: "Background\n\nIdentifying and assessing athletic talent in a country as vast and diverse as India is a significant challenge. Aspiring athletes, particularly from rural and remote areas, often lack access to standardized assessment facilities or opportunities to showcase their talent. The absence of reliable and scalable talent assessment models hinders the discovery of potential athletes who could benefit from Government support. A set of standard fitness assessment tests - including height, weight, vertical jump, shuttle run, sit-ups, and endurance runs (Annexure A) - provides a scientific method to evaluate talent. However, the reach and implementation of such tests remain limited due to infrastructure constraints.\n\nProblem Description\n\nThe Sports Authority of India (SAI) requires an innovative, mobile-based solution to democratize sports talent assessment. The proposed platform should:\n\n1. Enable athletes to download an app and record videos of their performance in the prescribed fitness assessment tests.\n2. Use AI/ML-based on-device verification to analyze the recorded videos for accuracy and authenticity (e.g., detecting jump height, counting sit-ups, or measuring time/distance in runs).\n3. Securely submit verified data to SAI servers for further evaluation and athlete profiling.\n4. Be low-cost and lightweight, ensuring accessibility even on entry-level smartphones and low-bandwidth networks.\n\nInnovative Features\n\n1. AI-based Cheat Detection: Identify anomalies or manipulations (e.g., tampered videos or incorrect movements) to ensure fair assessments.\n2. Offline Video Analysis: Perform preliminary performance analysis directly on the device without requiring continuous internet connectivity.\n3. Performance Benchmarking: Compare athlete performance against age/gender-based benchmarks, providing instant feedback.\n4. Gamified User Interface: Use progress badges, leaderboards, and interactive visuals to engage athletes and encourage participation.\n5. Auto-Test Segmentation: Automatically detect and segment performance clips (e.g., counting reps in sit-ups or analyzing vertical jumps) to reduce manual effort.\n\nExpected Deliverables\n\n1. A mobile application (Android/iOS) that allows video recording and assessment of athletes performance across the test batteries.\n2. AI/ML modules for on-device video analysis, verification of test results, and cheat detection.\n3. A secure backend system to transmit data to the Sports Authority of India for further processing.\n4. A dashboard for officials to view and evaluate verified performance data.\n\nExpected Impact\n\n1. Democratization of sports talent assessment, reaching even remote areas.\n2. Low-cost, scalable solution enabling mass participation in talent identification initiatives.\n3. Improved efficiency and transparency in evaluating and discovering potential athletes.",
